^fn1a Exact dates are not agreed. The ^i[Sri Lanka Chronicles]give the lengths of reigns of kings of Sri Lanka back to the time of the Buddha and also of kings of Magadha from Asoka back to the same time. Calculated backwards the list gives 543 BCE as the year of the Buddha’s parinibbāna (see list of kings in Codrington’s ^i[Short History of Ceylon], Macmillan 1947, p. xvi.). For adjustments to this calculation that bring the date of the parinibbāna forward to 483 BCE (the date most generally accepted in Europe), see e.g. Geiger, ^i[Mahāvaísa] translation (introduction) ^i[Epigraphia Zeylanica]I, 156; E. J. Thomas, ^i[Life of the Buddha], Kegan Paul, p. 26, n.1. It seems certain, however, that Mahānāma was reigning in the year 428 because of a letter sent by him to the Chinese court (Codrington p.29; E.Z. III, 12). If the adjusted date is accepted then 60 extra years have somehow to be squeezed out without displacing Mahānāma’s reign. Here the older date has been used.
^fn2a See also ^i[A Record of Buddhist Religion] by I-tsing, translation by J. Takakusu, Claren do Press, 1896, p. xxiii, where a geographical distribution of various schools gives Mūlasarvāstivāda mainly in the north and Ariyasthavira mainly in the south of India. I-tsing, who did not visit Sri Lanka, was in India at the end of the 7th cent.; but he does not mention whether the Ariyasthavira (Theravāda) Nikāya in India pursued its studies in the Pali of its Tipiṭaka or in Sanskrit or in a local vernacular.
^fn3a In the epilogues and prologues of various works between the 5th and 12th centuries there is mention of e.g., Badaratittha (Vism-a prol.: near Chennai), Kañcipura (A-a epil.:= Conjevaram near Chennai), and other places where different teachers accepting the Great Monastery tradition lived and worked. See also Malalasekera, ^i[Pali Literature of Ceylon,] p. 13; E.Z., IV, 69-71; Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, Vol. XIX, pp. 278f.
^fn4a Possibly the Vinaya summaries, ^i[Mūlasikkhā] and ^i[Khuddasikkhā] (though Geiger places these much later), as well as some works of Buddhadatta Thera. It has not been satisfactorily explained why the ^i[Mahāvaísa,] composed in the late 4th or early 5th cent., ends abruptly in the middle of Chapter 37 with Mahāsena’s reign (the Chronicle being only resumed eight centuries later).
^fn5a The ^i[Gandhavaísa] also gives the Apadāna Commentary as by him.
^fn6a Other readings are: Mayūrarūpaṭṭana, Mayūradūtapaṭṭana. Identified with Mylapore near Chennai (J.O.R., Madras, Vol. XIX, p. 281).
^fn7a Identified with Conjevaram near Chennai: PLC, p. 113. Ācariya Ānanda, author of the sub-commentary to the Abhidhamma Pitaka (^i[Mūla ṭīkā]), also lived there, perhaps any time after the middle of the 5th century. The Elder Dhammapāla sometimes refers to the old Sinhalese commentaries as if they were still available to him.
^fn8a Other readings are: Moraṇḍakheṭaka, Mudantakhedaka, Muraṇḍakheṭaka, etc.; not yet identified. Refers more probably to his birthplace than to his place of pabbajjā. See also J.O.R., Madras, Vol. XIX, p. 282, article “Buddhaghosa—His Place of Birth” by R. Subramaniam and S. P. Nainar, where a certain coincidence of names is mentioned that might suggest a possible identification of Moraṇḍakheṭaka (^i[moraṇḍa] being Pali for ‘peacock egg’ and ^i[khedaka] Skr. for “village”—see Vism Ae ed., p. xv) with adjacent villages, 51 miles from Nāgārjunakoṇḍa and 58 miles from Amarāvatī, called Kotanemalipuri and Gundlapalli (^i[nemali] and ^i[gundla] being Telegu respectively for “peacock” and “egg”). However, more specific information will be needed in support before it can be accepted as an indication that the ^i[Mahāvaísa] is wrong about his birthplace. More information about any connection between Sri Lanka and those great South Indian Buddhist centres is badly needed.
^fn9 A definite statement that the Dhp-a was written later by someone else can hardly avoid the inference that the “postscript” was a fraud, or at least misleading.

^fn13a For instance, Prof. Kosambi, in his preface to the ^i[Visuddhimagga], Harvard ed., overlooks these considerations when he says: “More positive evidence (that he was not a North-Indian Brahman) is in the passage ^i[’Uṇhassa ti aggisantāpassa. Tassa vanadāhādisu sambhavo veditabbo’] (I.86). ’Heat: the heat of fire, such as occurs at the time of forest fires, etc.’” This is a comment upon protection against heat given by a ^i[cīvara]. His explanation is obviously ridiculous: “It is not known to Indian southerners that a bare skin is sure to be sunburnt in the northern summer” (p. xii). And Professor Kosambi has not only overlooked the fact that it is almost certainly translated material that he is criticizing as original composition, but he appears not to have even read the whole passage. The sutta sentence (M I 10) commented on in the ^i[Visuddhimagga] (I.86-87) contains two words ^i[uṇha] and ^i[ātapa.]If, before condemning the explanation as “ridiculous,” he had read on, he would have found, a line or two below, the words ^i[Ātapo ti suriyātapo] (“‘Burning’ is burning of the sun”—I.87).
^fn14a The allusion is to the author of various Pali works including the ^i[Abhidhammāvatāra;] see n. 4.

^fn17a Hastings’ ^i[Encyclopaedia of Religion,] article “Buddhaghosa” by T. W. Rhys Davids. Note also that another elder of the same name invited the writing of the ^i[Sammohavinodanī.] The problem is discussed at some length by Prof. Niharranjan Ray, ^i[Theravada Buddhism in Burma,] pp. 24ff.
^fn18 The legitimateness of the mental moment of “presence” ^i[(ṭhiti)] as deducible from A I 152 is questioned by Ācariya Ānanda (Vibh-ṭ), who wrote early in the Middle Period; he cites the Yamaka (refs.: II 13–14; and I 216-17) against it.
^fn19a The Elder Dhammapāla, commenting on Vism XXI.77, takes the reading ^i[phuṭṭhantaí sacchikato] and explains that (cf. ^i[Mūla ṭīkā], Pug-ṭ 32), but the Elder Mahānāma, commenting on the Paṭisambhidāmagga from which the passage is quoted, takes the reading ^i[phuṭṭhattā sacchikato] and comments differently (Paṭis-a 396, Hewavitarne ed.). Again, what is referred to as “said by some ^i[(keci)”] in the Elder Dhammapāla’s comment on the ^i[Visuddhimagga] (see Vism VIII, n.46) is put forward by the Elder Mahānāma with no such reservation (Paṭis-a 351). It is the usual standard of strict consistency that makes such very minor divergences noticeable. These two commentators, though, rarely reproduce each other ^i[verbatim.] Contrastingly, where the ^i[Paramatthamañjūsā] and the ^i[Mūlaṭīkā] similarly overlap, the sentences are mostly ^i[verbatim,] but the former, with extra material, looks like an expanded version of the latter, or the latter a cut version of the former.
^fn20a See A II 56; Paṭis II 92f.
^fn21a In the present work the development of serenity (concentration) is carried to its limit before insight (understanding) is dealt with. This is for clarity. But in the commentary to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (DN 22, MN 10) either the two are developed contemporaneously or insight is allowed to precede jhāna concentration. According to the Suttas, concentration of jhāna strength is necessary for the manifestation of the path (see e.g. XIV.127; XV, n.7; D II 313 = M III 252; A II 156, quoted at Paṭis II 92f.).

^fn25a Pronounce letters as follows: ^i[a] as in countryman, ^i[ā] father, ^i[e] whey, ^i[i] chin, ^i[ī] machine, ^i[u] full, ^i[ū] rule; c church (always), ^i[g] give (always); ^i[h] always sounded separately, e.g. ^i[bh] in cab-horse, ^i[ch] in catch him (not kitchen), ^i[ph] in upholstery (not telephone), ^i[th] in hot- house (not pathos), etc.; ^i[j] joke; ^i[í] and ^i[ṅ] as ng in singer, ^i[ñ] as ^i[ni] in onion; ^i[ḍ, ḷ, ṇ] and ^i[ṭ] are pronounced with tongue-tip on palate; ^i[d, t, n] and with tongue-tip on teeth; double consonants as in Italian, e.g. ^i[dd] as in mad dog (not madder), ^i[gg] as in big gun (not bigger); rest as in English.
^fn26a Of the principal English value words, “real,” “truth,” “beauty,” “good,” “absolute,” “being,” etc.: “real” has been used for ^i[tatha] (XVI.24), “truth” allotted to ^i[sacca] (XVI.25) and “beauty” to ^i[subha] (IX.119); “good” has been used sometimes for the prefix ^i[su-] and also for the adj. ^i[kalyāṇa] and the subst. ^i[attha.] “Absolute” has not been employed, though it might perhaps be used for the word ^i[advaya,] which qualifies the word ^i[kasiṇa] (“universality,” “totalization”) at M II 14, and then: “One (man) perceives earth as a universality above, below, around, absolute, measureless” could be an alternative for the rendering given in V.38. “Being” (as abstract subst.) has sometimes been used for ^i[bhava,] which is otherwise rendered by “becoming.”

^fn3 “The words ‘insight alone’ are meant to exclude not virtue, etc., but serenity (i.e. ^i[jhāna]), which is the opposite number in the pair, serenity and insight. This is for emphasis. But the word ‘alone’ actually excludes only that concentration with distinction [of jhāna]; for concentration is classed as both access and absorption (see IV.32). Taking this stanza as the teaching for one whose vehicle is insight does not imply that there is no concentration; for no insight comes about without momentary concentration. And again, insight should be understood as the three contemplations of impermanence, pain, and not-self; not contemplation of impermanence alone” (Vism-mhṭ 9–10).
^fn4 “‘Develops’ applies to both ‘consciousness’ and ‘understanding.’ But are they mundane or supramundane? They are supramundane, because the sublime goal is described; for one developing them is said to disentangle the tangle of craving by cutting it off at the path moment, and that is not mundane. But the mundane are included here too because they immediately precede, since supramundane (see Ch. III n. 5) concentration and insight are impossible without mundane concentration and insight to precede them; for without the access and absorption concentration in one whose vehicle is serenity, or without the momentary concentration in one whose vehicle is insight, and without the gateways to liberation (see XXI.66f.), the supramundane can never in either case be reached” (Vism-mhṭ 13). “With triple root-cause” means with non-greed, none-hate, and non-delusion.
^fn5 One who is virtuous has nothing to be remorseful about.
^fn6 The three kinds of clear-vision are: recollection of past lives, knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings (divine eye), and knowledge of destruction of cankers (M I 22–23). The six kinds of direct-knowledge are: knowledge of supernormal power, the divine ear element, penetration of minds, recollection of past lives, knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings, and knowledge of destruction of cankers (M I 34–35). The four discriminations are those of meaning, law, language, and intelligence (A II 160).
^fn7 “Consciousness-concomitants” (^i[cetasikā]) is a collective term for feeling, perception, and formation, variously subdivided; in other words, aspects of mentality that arise together with consciousness.
^fn8 ^i[Sīlana] and ^i[upadhāraṇa] in this meaning (cf. Ch. I, §141 and ^i[sandhāraṇa], XIV.61) are not in PED.
^fn9 The three kinds of profitable bodily kamma or action (not killing or stealing or indulging in sexual misconduct), the four kinds of profitable verbal kamma or action (refraining from lying, malicious speech, harsh speech, and gossip), and right livelihood as the eighth.
^fn10 ^i[Uposatha] (der. from ^i[upavasati], to observe or to prepare) is the name for the day of “fasting” or “vigil” observed on the days of the new moon, waxing half moon, full moon, and waning half moon. On these days it is customary for laymen to undertake the Eight Precepts (^i[sīla]) or Five Precepts. On the new-moon and full-moon days the Pātimokkha (see note 11) is recited by bhikkhus. The two quarter-moon days are called the “eighth of the half moon.” The Full-moon day is called the “fifteenth” (i.e. fifteen days from the new moon) and is the last day of the lunar month. That of the new moon is called the “fourteenth” when it is the second and fourth new moon of the four- month season (i.e. fourteen days from the full moon), the other two are called the “fifteenth.” This compensates for the irregularities of the lunar period.
^fn11 The Suttavibhaṅga, the first book of the Vinaya Piṭaka, contains in its two parts the 227 rules for bhikkhus and the rules for bhikkhunīs, who have received the admission (^i[upasampadā]), together with accounts of the incidents that led to the announcement of the rules, the modification of the rules and the explanations of them. The bare rules themselves form the Pātimokkha for bhikkhus and that for bhikkhunīs. They are also known as the “two codes” (^i[dve mātikā]). The Pātimokkha is recited by bhikkhus on the Uposatha days of the full moon and new moon.
^fn12 The “ten instances of talk” (^i[dasa kathāvatthūni]) refer to the kinds of talk given in the Suttas thus: “Such talk as is concerned with effacement, as favours the heart’s release, as leads to complete dispassion, fading, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, Nibbāna, that is to say: talk on wanting little, contentment, seclusion, aloofness from contact, strenuousness, virtue, concentration, understanding, deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliverance” (M I 145; III 113).
^fn13 See Ch. IV n. 27.
^fn14 “‘^i[On seeing a visible object with the eye]”: if the eye were to see the visible object, then (organs) belonging to other kinds of consciousness would see too; but that is not so. Why? Because the eye has no thought (^i[acetanattā]). And then, were consciousness itself to see a visible object, it would see it even behind a wall because of being independent of sense resistance (^i[appaṭighabhāvato]); but that is not so either because there is no seeing in all kinds of consciousness. And herein, it is consciousness dependent on the eye that sees, not just any kind. And that does not arise with respect to what is enclosed by walls, etc., where light is excluded. But where there is no exclusion of light, as in the case of a crystal or a mass of cloud, there it does arise even with respect to what is enclosed by them. So it is as a basis of consciousness that the eye sees.
“‘^i[When there is the impingement of door and object]’: what is intended is: when a visible datum as object has come into the eye’s focus. ‘^i[One sees]’: one looks (^i[oloketi]); for when the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its material support is disclosing (^i[obhāsente]) by means of the special quality of its support a visible datum as object that is assisted by light (^i[āloka]), then it is said that a person possessed of that sees the visible datum. And here the illuminating is the revealing of the visible datum according to its individual essence, in other words, the apprehending of it experientially (^i[paccakkhato]).
“Here it is the ‘^i[sign of woman]’ because it is the cause of perceiving as ‘woman’ all such things as the shape that is grasped under the heading of the visible data (materiality) invariably found in a female continuity, the un-clear-cut-ness (^i[avisadatā]) of the flesh of the breasts, the beardlessness of the face, the use of cloth to bind the hair, the un-clear-cut stance, walk, and so on. The ‘^i[sign of man]’ is in the opposite sense. “‘^i[The sign of beauty]’ here is the aspect of woman that is the cause for the arising of lust. By the word ‘etc.’ the sign of resentment (^i[paṭigha]), etc., are included, which should be understood as the undesired aspect that is the cause for the arising of hate. And here admittedly only covetousness and grief are specified in the text but the sign of equanimity needs to be included too; since there is non-restraint in the delusion that arises due to overlooking, or since ‘forgetfulness of unknowing’ is said below (§57). And here the ‘sign of equanimity’ should be understood as an object that is the basis for the kind of equanimity associated with unknowing through overlooking it. So ‘^i[the sign of beauty], etc.’ given in brief thus is actually the cause of greed, hate, and delusion. “‘^i[He stops at what is merely seen]’: according to the Sutta method, ‘The seen shall be merely seen’ (Ud 8). As soon as the colour basis has been apprehended by the consciousnesses of the cognitive series with eye-consciousness he stops; he does not fancy any aspect of beauty, etc., beyond that…. In one who fancies as beautiful, etc., the limbs of the opposite sex, defilements arisen with respect to them successively become particularized, which is why they are called ‘particulars.’ But these are simply modes of interpreting (^i[sannivesākāra]) the kinds of materiality derived from the (four) primaries that are interpreted (^i[sanniviṭṭha]) in such and such wise; for apart from that there is in the ultimate sense no such thing as a hand and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 40–41). See also Ch.III, note 31.
^fn15 “As the elder was going along (occupied) only in keeping his meditation subject in mind, since noise is a thorn to those in the early stage, he looked up with the noise of the laughter, (wondering) ‘What is that?’ ‘Perception of foulness’ is perception of bones; for the elder was then making bones his meditation subject. The elder, it seems as soon as he saw her teeth-bones while she was laughing, got the counterpart sign with access jhāna because he had developed the preliminary-work well. While he stood there he reached the first jhāna. Then he made that the basis for insight, which he augmented until he attained the paths one after the other and reached destruction of cankers” (Vism-mhṭ 41–42).
^fn16 To expect to find in the ^i[Paramatthamañjūsā] an exposition of the “cognitive series” (^i[citta-vīthi]), and some explanation of the individual members in addition to what is to be found in the ^i[Visuddhimagga] itself, is to be disappointed. There are only fragmentary treatments. All that is said here is this:
“There is no unvirtuousness, in other words, bodily or verbal misconduct, in the five doors; consequently restraint of unvirtuousness happens through the mind door, and the remaining restraint happens through the six doors. For the arising of forgetfulness and the other three would be in the five doors since they are unprofitable states opposed to mindfulness, etc.; and there is no arising of unvirtuousness consisting in bodily and verbal transgression there because five-door impulsions do not give rise to intimation. And the five kinds of non-restraint beginning with unvirtuousness are stated here as the opposite of the five kinds of restraint beginning with restraint as virtue” (Vism-mhṭ 42). See also Ch. IV, note 13.
^fn17 This apparently incomplete sentence is also in the Pāḷi text. It is not clear why. (BPS Ed.)
^fn18 The formula “^i[kuhana kuhāyanā kuhitattaí],” i.e. verbal noun in two forms and abstract noun from pp., all from the same root, is common in Abhidhamma definitions. It is sometimes hard to produce a corresponding effect in English, yet to render such groups with words of different derivation obscures the meaning and confuses the effect.
^fn19 The renderings “scheming” and so on in this context do not in all cases agree with PED. They have been chosen after careful consideration. The rendering “rejection of requisites” takes the preferable reading ^i[paṭisedhana] though the more common reading here is ^i[paṭisevana] (cultivation).
^fn20 The Pali is: “^i[Icchāpakatassā ti icchāya apakatassa; upaddutassā ti attho.” Icchāya apakatassa] simply resolves the compound ^i[icchāpakatassa] and is therefore untranslatable into English. Such resolutions are therefore sometimes omitted in this translation.
^fn21 “‘^i[Putrid urine]’ is the name for all kinds of cow’s urine whether old or not” (Vism- mhṭ 45). Fermented cow’s urine with gallnuts (myrobalan) is a common Indian medicine today.
^fn22 It is not always certain now what kind of buildings these names refer to.
^fn23 ^i[Nahanā—]tying, from ^i[nayhati] (to tie). The noun in not in PED.
^fn24 The story of the oil-seller is given in the ^i[Sammohavinodanī] (Vibh-a 483), which reproduces this part of Vism with some additions: “Two bhikkhus, it seems, went into a village and sat down in the sitting hall. Seeing a girl, they called her. Then one asked the other, ‘Whose girl is this, venerable sir?’—‘She is the daughter of our supporter the oil- seller, friend. When we go to her mother’s house and she gives us ghee, she gives it in the pot. And this girl too gives it in the pot as her mother does.’” Quoted at Vism-mhṭ 46.
^fn25 The “ten instances of abuse” (^i[akkosa-vatthu]) are given in the ^i[Sammohavinodanī] (Vibh-340) as: “You are a thief, you are a fool, you are an idiot, you are a camel (oṭṭha), you are an ox, you are a donkey, you belong to the states of loss, you belong to hell, you are a beast, there is not even a happy or an unhappy destiny to be expected for you” (see also Sn-a 364).
^fn26 The following words of this paragraph are not in PED: ^i[Pāpanā] (denigration), ^i[pāpanaí] (nt. denigrating), ^i[nippeseti](scrapes off—from ^i[piísati]? cf. ^i[nippesikatā]— “belittling” §§42, 64), ^i[nippuñchati] (wipes off—only ^i[puñchati] in PED), ^i[pesikā] (scraper—not in this sense in PED: from same root as ^i[nippeseti]), ^i[nippiísitvā] (grinding, pounding), ^i[abbhaṅga] (unguent = ^i[abbhañjana], Vism-mhṭ 47).
^fn27 For attention (^i[manasi-kāra])as the means (^i[upāya]) and the way (^i[patha]) see M-a I 64.
^fn28 ^i[Avadhi]—“limit” = ^i[odhi]: this form is not in PED (see M-a II 292).
^fn29 “^i[Child’s flesh]” (^i[putta-maísa]) is an allusion to the story (S II 98) of the couple who set out to cross a desert with an insufficient food supply but got to the other side by eating the flesh of their child who died on the way. The derivation given in PED, “A metaphor probably distorted from ^i[pūtamaísa],” has no justification. The reference to rafts might be to D II 89.
^fn30 “‘^i[Making the whole rock resound]’: ‘making the whole rock reverberate as one doing so by means of an earth tremor. But some say that is was owing to the cheering of the deities who lived there’” (Vism-mhṭ 58).
^fn31 “Four-sweets”—^i[catumadhura]:a medicinal sweet made of four ingredients: honey, palm-sugar, ghee and sesame oil.
^fn32 “The Elder Mahā Tissa, it seems, was going on a journey during a famine, and being tired in body and weak through lack of food and travel weariness, he lay down at the root of a mango tree covered with fruit. There were many fallen mangoes here and there” (Vism-mhṭ 60). “Through ownerless mangoes were lying fallen on the ground near him, he would not eat them in the absence of someone to accept them from” (Vism- mhṭ 65). “Then a lay devotee, who was older than he, went to the elder, and learning of his exhaustion, gave him mango juice to drink. Then he mounted him on his back and took him to his home. Meanwhile the elder admonished himself as follows: ‘Nor your mother nor your father,’ etc. (see §133). And beginning the comprehension [of formations], and augmenting insight, he realized Arahantship after the other paths in due succession while he was still mounted on his back” (Vism-mhṭ 60).
^fn33 “‘^i[As elements]’ in this way: ‘This robe, etc., consists merely of [the four] elements and occurs when its conditions are present; and the person who uses it [likewise].’ ‘^i[As repulsive]’ in this way: Firstly perception of repulsiveness in nutriment in the case of alms food; then as bringing repulsiveness to mind thus: ‘But all these robes, etc., which are not in themselves disgusting, become utterly disgusting on reaching this filthy body’” (Vism-mhṭ 61).
^fn34 “‘^i[Use as theft]’: use by one who is unworthy. And the requisites are allowed by the Blessed One to one in his own dispensation who is virtuous, not unvirtuous; and the generosity of the givers is towards one who is virtuous, not towards one who is not, since they expect great fruit from their actions” (Vism-mhṭ 61; cf. MN 142 and commentary).
^fn35 The figures depend on whether ^i[koṭi] is taken as 1,000,000 or 100,000 or 10,000.
^fn36 “Comprehending” (^i[sammasana]) is a technical term that will become clear in Chapter XX. In short, it is inference that generalizes the “three characteristics” from one’s own directly-known experience to all possible formed experience at all times (see S II 107). Commenting on “^i[He comprehended that same illness]” (§138), Vism-mhṭ says: “He exercised insight by discerning the feeling in the illness under the heading of the feeling [aggregate] and the remaining material dhammas as materiality” (Vism-mhṭ 65).
^fn37 A story of the Jambu River and its gold is given at M-a IV 147.
^fn38 This list describes, in terms of abandoning, etc., the stages in the normal progress from ignorance to Arahantship, and it falls into the following groups: I. ^i[Virtue]: the abandoning of the ten unprofitable courses of action (1–10). II. ^i[Concentration]: A. abandoning the seven hindrances to concentration by means of their opposites (11– 17); B. The eight attainments of concentration, and what is abandoned by each (18–25). III.^i[Understanding]: A. Insight: the eighteen principal insights beginning with the seven contemplations (26–43). B. Paths: The four paths and what is abandoned by each (44–47).
^fn39 ^i[Sabbhāva]—“presence” ( = ^i[sat] + ^i[bhāva]): not in PED. Not to be confused with ^i[sabhāva]— “individual essence” ( = ^i[sa] (Skr. ^i[sva]) + ^i[bhāva], or ^i[saha] + ^i[bhāva]).
^fn40 The seven consisting of ^i[pārājikā, saṅghādisesā , pācittiyā, pāṭidesanīyā, dukkaṭā, thullaccayā, dubbhāsitā] (mentioned at M-a II 33).

He asked, ‘Are you a sitter, venerable sir?’ Out of fewness of wishes that his ascetic practice should get known, the elder lay down. Afterwards he undertook the practice anew. So the story has come down. (Vism-mhṭ 77)”
^fn7 “The name of a street in Mahāgāma (S.E. Sri Lanka). Also in Anurādhapura, they say” (Vism-mhṭ 77).
^fn8 On certain occasions, when the going forth was given by the Buddha with only the words, ^i[“Ehi bhikkhu] (Come, bhikkhu),” owing to the disciple’s past merit robes appeared miraculously upon him (see e.g. Vin Mahāvagga, Kh. 1).
^fn9 ^i[Apādana]—”institution (or production),” not in PED.
^fn10 ^i[Tatraṭṭhaka-paccattharaṇa]—”a bedspread that remains there”; “A name for what has been determined upon as a bedspread in one’s own resting place or in someone else’s. They say accordingly (it is said in a commentary) that there is no breach of the ascetic practice even when these two, that is, the bedspread and the undyed cloth, are kept as extra robes” (Vism-mhṭ 78–79). For ^i[tatraṭṭhaka] (fixture) see also §61.
^fn11 “A meal to be given by setting it out in a principal house only.” (Vism-mhṭ 79) This meaning of ^i[dhura-bhatta] not in PED.
^fn12 “Tickets that are not for actual food, but deal with medicine, etc.” (Vism-mhṭ 79) ^i[Paṭikkamana—”refectory”](28) = ^i[bojun hal] (eating hall) in Sinhalese translation.
^fn13 ^i[Sakkarā]—”sugar”: spelt ^i[sakkharā] in PED.
^fn14 ^i[Subbata]—”truly devoted”: fm. ^i[su] + ^i[vata] (having good vows). See also §59.
^fn15 Reading ^i[acchinna-mariyādaí] with Vism-mhṭ, which says: ^i[“‘Without a drip-ledge cut (acchinna-mariyādaí)’] means without a drip-ledge ^i[(mariyāda)] made above, which might come under the heading of a drip-ledge ^i[(mariyāda-saṅkhepena)] made to prevent rain water from coming in. But if the rain water comes under the overhang ^i[(pabbhāra)] and is allowed to go in under it, then this comes under the heading of the open air ^i[(abbhokāsika-saṅkhepa)”] (Vism-mhṭ 84). This seems to refer to the widespread habit in ancient Sri Lanka of cutting a drip-ledge on overhanging rocks used for bhikkhus’ dwellings so that the rain that falls on top of the rock drips down in front of the space under the overhang instead of trickling down under the rock and wetting the back and floor. ^i[Pabbhāra] in this context is “over hang” rather than “slope.”
^fn16 “He should not go into families’ houses because he smells of the dead and is followed by ^i[pisāca] goblins” (Vism-mhṭ 84).
^fn17 ^i[Āyogapatta]—”a binding-strap”: this is probably the meaning. But cf. Vin II 135 and Vin-a 891.
^fn18 For the triads of the ^i[Abhidhamma Mātikā] (Abhidhamma Schedule) see Ch. XIII, n.20. ^i[“‘Those who hold’:] a reference to the inhabitants of the Abhayagiri Monastery at Anurādhapura. For they say that ascetic practice is a concept consisting in a name ^i[(nāma-paññatti).] That being so, they could have no meaning of shaking off defilements, or possibility of being undertaken, because in the ultimate sense they would be non- existent [concepts having no existence]” (Vism-mhṭ 87). Cf. IV.29.
^fn19 ^i[Āpajjati] (and its noun ^i[āpatti)] is the normal word used for undesirable consequences that follow on some unsound logical proposition. See XVI.68f. This meaning is not in PED.
^fn20 ^i[Idamatthitā]—”that specific quality”: “Owing to these profitable states it exists, (thus it is ‘specific by those’; ^i[imehi kusaladhammehi atthi] = ^i[idam-atthi).] The knowledge by means of which one who has gone forth should be established in the refuse-rag-wearer’s practice, etc., and by means of which, on being so instructed one undertakes and persists in the ascetic qualities—that knowledge is ^i[idamatthitā]” (Vism-mhṭ 88).
^fn21 See XXI.117.

^fn1 The answer to question (vii) stretches from III.27 to XI.119. That to question (viii) from XI. 120 up to the end of Ch. XIII.
^fn2 ^i[“Cittass’ ekaggatā]” is rendered here as “unification of mind” in the sense of agreement or harmony (cf. ^i[samagga)] of consciousness and its concomitants in focusing on a single object (see A I 70). It is sometimes rendered “one-pointedness” in that sense, or in the sense of the focusing of a searchlight. It may be concluded that this term is simply a synonym for ^i[samādhi] and nothing more, firstly from its use in the suttas, and secondly from the fact that it is given no separate definition in the description of the formations aggregate in Ch. XIV. Cf. gloss at M-a I 124.
^fn3 “The characteristic of non-distraction is the individual essence peculiar to concentration. Hence no analysis of it is possible, which is why he said: ^i[‘It is of one kind with the characteristic of non-distraction’”] (Vism-mhṭ 91).
^fn4 “Applied thought that occurs as though absorbing ^i[(appento)] associated states in the object is absorption ^i[(appanā).] Accordingly it is described as ‘absorption, absorbing ^i[(appanā vyappanā)’] (M III 73). Now since that is the most important, the usage of the Commentaries is to call all exalted and unsurpassed jhāna states ‘absorption’ [as well as the applied thought itself], and likewise to apply the term of common usage ‘access’ to the limited [i.e. sense-sphere] jhāna that heralds the arising of the former, just as the term ‘village access,’ etc. is applied to the neighbourhood of a village” (Vism-mhṭ 91).
^fn5 “The round ^i[(vaṭṭa,] see XVII.298) [including fine-material and immaterial heavens] is called the world ^i[(loka)] because of its crumbling ^i[(lujjana)] and disintegrating ^i[(palujjana). ‘Mundane’ (lokiya)] means connected with the world because of being included in it or found there. ^i[‘Supramundane’ (lokuttara)] means beyond the world, excepted from it^i[,] because of not being included in it [through being associated with Nibbāna]” (Vism- mhṭ 91). See also “nine supramundane states. (VII.68, 74f.)”
^fn6 In loose usage ^i[pīti] (happiness) and ^i[sukha] (pleasure or bliss) are almost synonyms. They become differentiated in the jhāna formulas (see IV.100), and then technically ^i[pīti], as the active thrill of rapture, is classed under the formations aggregate and ^i[sukha] under the feeling aggregate. The valuable word “happiness” was chosen for ^i[pīti] rather than the possible alternatives of “joy” (needed for ^i[somanassa),] “interest” (which is too flat), “rapture” (which is overcharged), or “zest.” For ^i[sukha,] while “pleasure” seemed to fit admirably where ordinary pleasant feeling is intended, another, less crass, word seemed necessary for the refined pleasant feeling of jhāna and the “bliss” of Nibbāna (which is not feeling aggregate—see M I 400). “Ease” is sometimes used.
“Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is intended here by ‘equanimity’ ^i[(upekkhā,] lit, onlooking); for it ‘looks on’ ^i[(upekkhati)] at the occurrence of [bodily] pleasure and pain by maintaining the neutral (central) mode” (Vism-mhṭ 92).
^fn7 ^i[Samatha]—”serenity” is a synonym for absorption concentration, and “insight” ^i[(vipassanā)] a synonym for understanding. ^i[Samatha] is sometimes rendered by “tranquillity” (reserved here for ^i[passaddhi)] or “calm” or “quiet.”
^fn8 One of the principal monasteries in Anurādhapura.
^fn9 ^i[Dve mātikā]—the “two codes”: see Ch. I, n. 11. But Vism-mhṭ says here: ^i[“‘Observers of the codes’]are observers of the codes (summaries) of the Dhamma and Vinaya” (Vism-mhṭ 117).
^fn10 ^i[Pavāraṇa:] ceremony held at the end of the rains, during three months of which season bhikkhus have to undertake to live in one place in order to avoid travel while crops are growing. It consists in a meeting of the bhikkhus who have spent the rains together, at which each member present invites ^i[(pavāreti)] the Community to point out his faults (breaches of Vinaya rules) committed during the preceding three months (Vin I 155).
^fn11 “^i[Pācinakhaṇḍarājā ti puratthimadisāya pabbatakhaṇḍānaí antare vanarājīṭṭhānaí]” (Vism-mhṭ 97).
^fn12 For the first five years after the admission ^i[(upasampadā)] a bhikkhu is called a “new ^i[(nava)] bhikkhu”; from five to ten years he is called a “middle ^i[(majjhima)] bhikkhu”; with ten or more years’ seniority he is called an “elder ^i[(thera)] bhikkhu.”
^fn13 The last sentence here might refer to a free mass distribution of gruel ^i[(yāgu),] which appears to have been more or less constantly maintained at Anurādhapura.
^fn14 It is usual to render the set phrase ^i[paṇītaí khādanīyaí bhojanīyaí] by some such phrase as “sumptuous food both hard and soft,” which is literal but unfamiliar- sounding.
^fn15 “The way of the Rathavinīta ^i[(Rathavinīta-paṭipadā)”:] this is a reference to certain suttas that were adopted by bhikkhus as a “way” ^i[(paṭipadā)] or guide to practice. The suttas mentioned here are Rathavinīta (M I 145), Nālaka (Sn, p. 131), Tuvaṭaka (Sn 179), Noble One’s Heritages (^i[ariyavaísa]—A II 27). Others are mentioned at M-a I 92; III 6; S-a III 291. The Ariyavaísa Sutta itself has a long commentary on practice, and it is mentioned in the Commentaries as a popular subject for preaching (see e.g. commentary to AN III 42).
^fn16 ^i[Sīmā]—”boundary”: loosely used in this sense, it corresponds vaguely to what is meant by “parish.” In the strict sense it is the actual area (usually a “chapter house”) agreed according to the rules laid down in the Vinaya and marked by boundary stones, within which the Community ^i[(saṅgha)] carries out its formal acts.
^fn17 ^i[Atthayitabba—”]needed”: not in PED, not in CPD.
^fn18 ^i[Māna,] usually rendered by “pride,” is rendered here both by “pride” and “conceit.” Etymologically it is derived perhaps from ^i[māneti] (to honour) or ^i[mināti] (to measure). In sense, however, it tends to become associated with ^i[maññati,] to conceive (false notions, see M I 1), to imagine, to think (as e.g. at Nidd I 80, Vibh 390 and comy.). As one of the “defilements” (see M I 36) it is probably best rendered by “pride.” In the expression ^i[asmi-māna] (often rendered by “the pride that says ‘I am’”) it more nearly approaches ^i[maññanā] (false imagining, misconception, see M III 246) and is better rendered by the “conceit ‘I am,’” since the word “conceit” straddles both the meanings of “pride” (i.e. haughtiness) and “conception.”
^fn19 “^i[‘Some’] is said with reference to the Elder Upatissa. For it is put in this way by him in the ^i[Vimuttimagga]. The word^i[‘apparently’] indicates dissent from what follows” (Vism-mhṭ 103). A similar passage to that referred to appears in Ch. 6 (Taisho ed. p. 410a) of the Chinese version of the ^i[Vimuttimagga], the only one extant.
^fn20 ^i[Sīlaka]—”good-tempered”—^i[sukhasīla] (good-natured—see §83), which = ^i[sakhila] (kindly—Vism-mhṭ 104). Not in PED.
^fn21 ^i[Ukkuṭika—”]springy^i[”] is glossed here by ^i[asamphuṭṭhamajjhaí] (“not touching in the middle”—Vism-mhṭ 106). This meaning is not in PED.
^fn22 See Sn-a 544, A-a 436.
^fn23 ^i[Siṅga]—”foppery” is not in PED in this sense. See Vibh 351 and commentary. ^i[Cāpalya (cāpalla)—”]personal vanity”: noun from adj. ^i[capala.] The word ^i[“capala”] comes in an often-repeated passage: ^i[“saṭhā māyāvino keṭubhino uddhatā unnalā capalā mukharā…”] (M I 32); cf. S I 203; A III 199, etc.) and also M I 470 ^i[“uddhato hoti capalo,”] with two lines lower ^i[“uddhaccaí cāpalyaí.” Cāpalya] also occurs at Vibh 351 (and M II 167). At M- a I 152 (commenting on M I 32) we find: ^i[capalā ti pattacīvaramaṇḍanādinā cāpallena yuttā] (“interested in personal vanity consisting in adorning bowl and robe and so on”), and at M-a III 185 (commenting on M I 470): ^i[Uddhato hoti capalo ti uddhaccapakatiko c’eva hoti cīvaramaṇḍanā pattamaṇḍanā senāsanamaṇḍanā imassa vā pūtikāyassa kelāyanamaṇḍanā ti evaí vuttena taruṇadārakacāpallena samannāgato] (“‘he is distracted—or puffed up—and personally vain’: he is possessed of the callow youth’s personal vanity described as adorning the robe, adorning the bowl, adorning the lodging, or prizing and adorning this filthy body”). This meaning is confirmed in the commentary to Vibh 251. PED does not give this meaning at all but only “fickle,” which is unsupported by the commentary. CPD ^i[(acapala)] also does not give this meaning.
As to the other things listed here in the ^i[Visuddhimagga] text, most will be found at M I 36. For “holding on tenaciously,” etc., see M I 43.
^fn24 ^i[Jatukā]—”a bat”: not in PED. Also at Ch. XI. §7.
^fn25 ^i[Jalapūvasadisa]—”like a net cake”: “A cake made like a net” (Vism-mhṭ 108); possiblywhat is now known in Sri Lanka as a “string hopper,” or something like it.
^fn26 ^i[Surabhi]—”scented^i[,] perfume”: not in PED; also at VI.90; X.60 and Vism-mhṭ 445.
^fn27 “^i[‘Kasiṇa’] is in the sense of entirety ^i[(sakalaṭṭhena)”] (M-a III 260). See IV.119.
^fn28 Here ten kinds of foulness are given. But in the Suttas only either five or six of this set appear to be mentioned, that is, “Perception of a skeleton, perception of the worm- infested, perception of the livid, perception of the cut-up, perception of the bloated. (see A I 42 and S V 131; A II 17 adds “perception of the festering”)” No details are given. All ten appear at Dhs 263–64 and Paṭis I 49. It will be noted that no order of progress of decay in the kinds of corpse appears here; also the instructions in Ch. VI are for contemplating actual corpses in these states. The primary purpose here is to cultivate “repulsiveness.”
Another set of nine progressive stages in the decay of a corpse, mostly different from these, is given at M I 58, 89, etc., beginning with a corpse one day old and ending with bones turned to dust. From the words “suppose a bhikkhu saw a corpse thrown on a charnel ground … he compares this same body of his with it thus, ‘This body too is of like nature, awaits a like fate, is not exempt from that’”(M I 58), it can be assumed that these nine, which are given in progressive order of decay in order to demonstrate the body’s impermanence, are not necessarily intended as contemplations of actual corpses so much as mental images to be created, the primary purpose being to cultivate impermanence. This may be why these nine are not used here (see VIII.43).
The word ^i[asubha] (foul, foulness) is used both of the contemplations of corpses as here and of the contemplation of the parts of the body (A V 109).
^fn29 Also quoted in A-a V 79 on AN 11:9. Cf. Sn 1119. A similar quotation with Sopāka is found in Vism-mhṭ 334–35, see note 1 to XI.2.
^fn30 The full story, which occurs at M-a III 382–83 and elsewhere, is this: “It seems that when the Karavīka bird has pecked a sweet-flavoured mango wth its beak and savoured the dripping juice, and flapping its wings, begins to sing, then quadrupeds caper as if mad. Quadrupeds grazing in their pastures drop the grass in their mouths and listen to the sound. Beasts of prey hunting small animals pause with one foot raised. Hunted animals lose their fear of death and halt in their tracks. Birds flying in the air stay with wings outstretched. Fishes in the water keep still, not moving their fins. All listen to the sound, so beautiful is the Karavīka’s song. Dhammāsoka’s queen Asandhamittā asked the Community: ‘Venerable sirs, is there anything that sounds like the Buddha?’— ‘The Karavīka birds does.’—‘Where are those birds, venerable sirs?’—‘In the Himalaya.’ She told the king: ‘Sire, I wish to hear a Karavīka bird.’ The king dispatched a gold cage with the order, ‘Let a Karavīka bird come and sit in this cage.’ The cage travelled and halted in front of a Karavīka. Thinking, ‘The cage has come at the king’s command; it is impossible not to go,’ the bird got in. The cage returned and stopped before the king. They could not get the Karavīka to utter a sound. When the king asked, ‘When do they utter a sound?’ they replied, ‘On seeing their kin.’ Then the king had it surrounded with looking-glasses. Seeing its own reflection and imagining that its relatives had come, it flapped its wings and cried out with an exquisite voice as if sounding a crystal trumpet. All the people in the city rushed about as if mad. Asandhamittā thought: ‘If the sound of this creature is so fine, what indeed can the sound of the Blessed One have been like since he had reached the glory of omniscient knowledge?’ and arousing a happiness that she never again relinquished, she became established in the fruition of stream-entry.”
^fn31 See Dhs 55^i[;] but it comes under the “… ^i[pe] …,” which must be filled in from pp. 37– 38, §182 and §184.
^fn32 “It is because only an abstract ^i[(parikappaja)] object can be extended, not any other kind, that he said, ^i[‘it is not possible to extend a state consisting in an individual essence’”] (Vism-mhṭ 110).
^fn33 The word ^i[“nimitta”] in its technical sense is consistently rendered here by the word “sign,” which corresponds very nearly if not exactly to most uses of it. It is sometimes rendered by “mark” (which over-emphasizes the concrete), and by “image” (which is not always intended). The three kinds, that is, the preliminary-work sign, learning sign and counterpart sign, do not appear in the Piṭakas. There the use rather suggests association of ideas as, for example, at M I 180, M I 119, A I 4, etc., than the more definitely visualized “image” in some instances of the “counterpart sign” described in the following chapters.
^fn34 ^i[Na-vattabba]—”not so-classifiable” is an Abhidhamma shorthand term for something that, when considered under one of the triads or dyads of the ^i[Abhidhamma Mātikā] (Dhs 1f.), cannot be placed under any one of the three, or two, headings.
^fn35 “‘^i[The festering’] is a mobile object because of the oozing of the pus, ^i[‘the bleeding’] because of the trickling of the blood, ^i[‘the worm-infested’] because of the wriggling of the worms. The mobile aspect of the sunshine coming in through a window opening is evident, which explains why an object consisting of a circle of sunlight is called mobile” (Vism-mhṭ 110).
^fn36 “In addition to the five things” (not quoted) dealt with earlier in the sutta, namely, perfection of virtue, good friendship, hearing suitable things, energy, and understanding.
^fn37 “‘^i[Cryptic books’:] the meditation-subject books dealing with the truths, the dependent origination, etc., which are profound and associated with voidness” (Vism- mhṭ 111). Cf. M-a II 264, A-a commentary to AN 4:180.

^fn1 “They say it is the Dakkhiṇagiri in the Magadha country” (Vism-mhṭ 116). There is mention of a Dakkhiṇagiri-vihāra at M-a II 293 and elsewhere.
^fn2 Read ^i[pamukhesu sosayanti. Pamukha] not thus in PED.
^fn3 “A ^i[‘water port of entry’] is a port of entry on the sea or on an estuary. A ^i[‘land port of entry’] is one on the edge of a forest and acts as the gateway on the road of approach to great cities” (Vism-mhṭ 116).
^fn4 “Said in the Old Commentary. ^i[‘One who is learning the earth kasiṇa’:] one who is apprehending, grasping, an earth kasiṇa as a ‘learning sign’. The meaning is, one who is producing an earth kasiṇa that has become the sign of learning; and here ‘arousing’ should be regarded as the establishing of the sign in that way. ^i[‘In earth’:] in an earth disk of the kind about to be described. ^i[‘Apprehends the sign’:] he apprehends in that, with knowledge connected with meditative development, the sign of earth of the kind about to be described, as one does with the eye the sign of the face in a looking-glass. ^i[‘Made up’:] prepared in the manner about to be described. ^i[‘Not made up’:] in a disk of earth consisting of an ordinary threshing-floor disk, and so on. ^i[‘Bounded’:] only in one that has bounds. As regard the words ^i[‘the size of a bushel’,] etc., it would be desirable that a bushel and a saucer were of equal size, but some say that ^i[‘the size of a saucer’] is a span and four fingers, and the ^i[‘the size of a bushel’] is larger than that. ^i[‘He sees to it that that sign is well apprehended’:] that meditator makes that disk of earth a well-apprehended sign. When, after apprehending the sign in it by opening the eyes, and looking and then closing them again, it appears to him as he adverts to it just as it did at the moment of looking with open eyes, then he has made it well apprehended. Having thoroughly established his mindfulness there, observing it again and again with his mind not straying outside, he sees that it is ^i[‘well attended to’.] When it is well attended to thus by adverting and attending again and again by producing much repetition and development instigated by that, he sees that it is ^i[‘well defined’. ‘To that object’:] to that object called earth kasiṇa, which has appeared rightly owing to its having been well apprehended. ^i[‘He anchors his mind’:] by bringing his own mind to access jhāna he anchors it, keeps it from other objects” (Vism-mhṭ 119).
^fn5 ^i[“Gaṅgā] (= ‘river’) is the name for the Ganges in India and for the Mahavaeligaṅgā, Sri Lanka’s principal river. However, in the Island of Sri Lanka there is a river, it seems, called the Rāvanagaṅgā. The clay in the places where the banks are cut away by its stream is the colour of dawn” (Vism-mhṭ 119).
^fn6 ^i[“‘Apprehend the sign’:] apprehend with the mind the sign apprehended by the eye in the earth kasiṇa. ^i[‘And develop it’:] the apprehending of the sign as it occurs should be continued intensively and constantly practiced” (Vism-mhṭ 120).
^fn7 “Just as one who sees his reflection ^i[(mukha-nimitta]—lit^i[.] “face-sign”) on the surface of a looking-glass does not open his eyes too widely or too little (in order to get the effect), nor does he review the colour of the looking-glass or give attention to its characteristic, but rather looks with moderately opened eyes and sees only the sign of his face, so too this meditator looks with moderately opened eyes at the earth kasiṇa and is occupied only with the sign” (Vism-mhṭ 121).
^fn8 “The dawn colour that is there in the kasiṇa should not be thought about, though it cannot be denied that it is apprehended by eye-consciousness. That is why, instead of saying here, ‘should not be looked at,’ he says that it should not be apprehended by reviewing. Also the earth element’s characteristic of hardness, which is there, should not be given attention because the apprehension has to be done through the channel of seeing. And after saying, ‘while not ignoring the colour’ he said, ‘relegating the colour to the position of a property of the physical support,’ showing that here the concern is not with the colour, which is the channel, but rather that this colour should be treated as an accessory of the physical support; the meaning is that the kasiṇa (disk) should be given attention with awareness of both the accompanying earth- aspect and its ancillary colour-aspect, but taking the earth-aspect with its ancillary concomitant colour as both supported equally by that physical support [the disk]. ‘On the concept as the mental datum since that is what is outstanding’: the term of ordinary usage ‘earth’ (^i[pathavī]) as applied to earth with its accessories, since the prominence of its individual effect is due to outstandingness of the earth element: ‘setting the mind’ on that mental datum consisting of a [name-] concept (^i[paññatti-dhamma]), the kasiṇa should be given attention as ‘earth, earth.’—If the mind is to be set on a mere concept by means of a term of common usage, ought earth to be given attention by means of different names?—It can be. What is wrong? It is to show that that is done he said, ‘^i[Mahī, medinī],’ and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 122).
^fn9 “‘^i[Comes into focus’:] becomes the resort of mind-door impulsion” (Vism-mhṭ 122).
^fn10 “Why should he not? If, after the learning sign was produced, he went on developing it by looking at the disk of the earth, there would be no arising of the counterpart sign” (Vism-mhṭ 122).
^fn11 “Stamped with the three characteristics of the formed beginning with rise (see A I 152), or marked with the three characteristics beginning with impermanence” (Vism- mhṭ 122).
^fn12 “If ‘it is not like that’—is not possessed of colour, etc.—then how is it the object of jhāna? It is in order to answer that question that the sentence beginning, ‘For it is …’ is given. ‘Born of the perception’: produced by the perception during development, simply born from the perception during development. Since there is no arising from anywhere of what has no individual essence, he therefore said, ‘Being the mere mode of appearance’” (Vism-mhṭ 122). See Ch. VIII, n. 11.
^fn13 ^i[Bhavaṅga] (life-continuum, lit. “constituent of becoming”) and ^i[javana] (impulsion) are first mentioned in this work at I.57 (see n. 16); this is the second mention. The “cognitive series” ^i[(citta-vīthi)] so extensively used here is unknown as such in the Piṭakas. Perhaps the seed from which it sprang may exist in, say, such passages as: “Due to eye and to visible data eye-consciousness arises. The coincidence of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What he feels he perceives. What he perceives he thinks about4. What he thinks about he diversifies [by means of craving, pride and false view] … Due to mind and to mental data …” (M I 111). And: “Is the eye permanent or impermanent … Are visible objects permanent or impermanent? … Is the mind permanent or impermanent? Are mental data … Is mind-consciousness … Is mind-contact … Is any feeling, any perception, any formation, any consciousness, that arises with mind-contact as condition permanent or impermanent?” (M III 279). And: “These five faculties [of eye, etc.] each with its separate objective field and no one of them experiencing as its objective field the province of any other, have mind as their refuge, and mind experiences their provinces as its objective field” (M I 295). This treatment of consciousness implies, as it were, more than even a “double thickness” of consciousness. An already-formed nucleus of the cognitive series, based on such Sutta Piṭakas material, appears in the Abhidhamma Piṭakas. The following two quotations show how the commentary (bracketed italics) expands the Abhidhamma Piṭakas treatment.
(i) “Herein, what is eye-consciousness element? Due to eye and to visible data (^i[as support condition, and to functional mind element] (= ^i[5-door adverting]), ^i[as disappearance condition, and to the remaining three immaterial aggregates as conascence condition]) there arises consciousness … which is eye-consciousness element. [Similarly with the other four sense elements.] Herein, what is mind element? Eye-consciousness having arisen and ceased, next to that there arises consciousness … which is appropriate (profitable or unprofitable) mind element (in the mode of receiving). [Similarly with the other four sense elements.] Or else it is the first reaction to any mental datum (to be taken as functional mind element in the mode of mind-door adverting). Herein, what is mind-consciousness element? Eye-consciousness having arisen and ceased, next to that there arises mind element. (Resultant) mind element having arisen and ceased, also (next to that there arises resultant mind-consciousness element in the mode of investigating; and that having arisen and ceased, next to that there arises functional mind-consciousness element in the mode of determining; and that having arisen and ceased) next to that there arises consciousness … which is appropriate mind- consciousness element (in the mode of impulsion). [Similarly with the other four sense elements.] Due to (life-continuum) mind and to mental data there arises consciousness … which is appropriate (impulsion) mind-consciousness element (following on the above-mentioned mind-door adverting)” (Vibh 87–90 and Vibh-a 81f.).
 (ii) “Eye-consciousness and its associated states are a condition, as proximity condition, for ^i[(resultant)] mind element and for its associated states. Mind element and its associated states are a condition, as proximity condition, for ^i[(root-causeless resultant)] mind-consciousness element ^i[(in the mode of investigating)] and for its associated states. ^i[(Next to that, the mind-consciousness elements severally in the modes of determining, impulsion, registration, and life-continuum should be mentioned, though they are not, since the teaching is abbreviated.)] [Similarly for the other four senses and mind-consciousness element]. Preceding profitable
^i[(impulsion)] states are a condition, as proximity condition, for subsequent indeterminate ^i[(registration, life-continuum)] states [etc.]” (Paṭṭh II, and Comy., 33–34).
The form that the two kinds (5-door and mind-door) of the cognitive series take is shown in Table V. The following are some Piṭakas references for the individual modes: ^i[bhavaṅga] (life-continuum): Paṭṭh I 159, 160, 169, 324; ^i[āvajjana] (adverting) Paṭṭh I 159, 160, 169, 324; ^i[sampaṭicchana] (receiving), ^i[santīraṇa] (investigating), ^i[voṭṭhapana] (determining), and ^i[tadārammaṇa] (registration) appear only in the Commentaries. ^i[Javana] (impulsion): Paṭis II 73, 76. The following references may also be noted here: ^i[anuloma] (conformity), Paṭṭh I 325. ^i[Cuti-citta] (death consciousness), Paṭṭh I 324. ^i[Paṭisandhi] (rebirth- linking), Vism-mhṭ 1, 320, etc.; Paṭis II 72, etc.
^fn14 North or south to avoid facing the rising sun in coming or going. ^i[Kosa] is not in PED; “one and a half ^i[kosa] = 3,000 bows” (Vism-mhṭ 123).
^fn15 Twenty-six kinds of “aimless” (lit. “animal”) talk are given in the Suttas (e.g. M II 1; III 113), which the commentary increases to thirty-two (M-a III 233). The ten instances of talk are those given in the Suttas (e.g. M I 145; III 113). See Ch. I, n.12.
^fn16 “One who is occupied with exercising and caring for the body” (Vism-mhṭ 124).
^fn17 ^i[Buddha]—“possessed of wit”: not in PED; see M-a I 39.
^fn18 “It guards the line (^i[gaí tāyati]), thus it is lineage (^i[gotta]). When it occurs limitedly, it guards the naming (^i[abhidhāna]) and the recognition (^i[buddhi]) of the naming as restricted to a definite scope (^i[ekaísa-visayatā]). For just as recognition does not take place without a meaning (^i[attha]) for its objective support (^i[ārammaṇa]), so naming (^i[abhidhāna]) does not take place without what is named (^i[abhidheyya]). So it (the ^i[gotta]) is said to protect and keep these. But the limited should be regarded as the materiality peculiar to sense- sphere states, which are the resort of craving for sense desires, and destitute of the exalted (fine-material and immaterial) or the unsurpassed (supramundane). The exalted lineage is explainable in the same way” (Vism-mhṭ 134).
^fn19 See XVII.189 and note.
^fn20 “The intention is that it is as if the sixth and seventh impulsions had lapsed since impulsion beyond the fifth is exhausted. The elder’s opinion was that just as the first impulsion, which lacks the quality of repetition, does not arouse change-of-lineage because of its weakness, while the second or the third, which have the quality of repetition, can do so because they are strong on that account, so too the sixth and seventh fix in absorption owing to their strength due to their quality of repetition. But it is unsupported by a sutta or by any teacher’s statement in conformity with a sutta. And the text quoted is not a reason because strength due to the quality of repetition is not a principle without exceptions ^i[(anekantikattā);] for the first volition, which is not a repetition, has result experienceable here and now, while the second to the sixth, which are repetitions, have result experienceable in future becomings” (Vism-mhṭ 135).
^fn21 “‘^i[Either in the fourth or the fifth,’] etc., is said for the purpose of concluding [the discussion] with a paragraph showing the correctness of the meaning already stated.— Herein, if the sixth and seventh impulsions are said to have lapsed because impulsion is exhausted, how does seventh-impulsion volition come to have result experienceable in the next rebirth and to be of immediate effect on rebirth?—This is not owing to strength got through a repetition condition.—What then?—It is owing to the difference in the function’s position ^i[(kiriyāvatthā).]For the function [of impulsion] has three positions, that is, initial, medial and final. Herein, experienceability of result in the next rebirth and immediateness of effect on rebirth are due to the last volition’s final position, not to its strength … So the fact that the sixth and seventh lapse because impulsion is used up cannot be objected to” (Vism-mhṭ 135). See Table V.
^fn22 “‘^i[The normal extent does not apply’] here ^i[‘in the seven instances’] because of the immeasurability of the conscious moment in some, and the extreme brevity of the moment in others; for ^i[‘extent’] is inapplicable here in the sense of complete cognitive series, which is why ‘in fruition next to the path,’ etc., is said” (Vism mhṭ 136).
^fn23 The five (see e.g. Paṭis II 220; M-a I 85) are suppression (by concentration), substitution of opposites (by insight), cutting off (by the path), tranquillization (by fruition), and escape (as Nibbāna); cf. five kinds of deliverance (e.g. M-a IV 168). The ^i[three] (see e.g. Nidd I 26; M-a II 143) are bodily seclusion (retreat), mental seclusion (jhāna), and seclusion from the substance or circumstances of becoming (Nibbāna).
^fn24 Here ^i[saṅkappa] (“thinking”) has the meaning of “hankering.” ^i[Chanda, kāma] and ^i[rāga] and their combinations need sorting out. ^i[Chanda] (zeal, desire) is much used, neutral in colour, good or bad according to context and glossed by “desire to act”; technically also one of the four roads to power and four predominances. ^i[Kāma] (sense desire, sensuality) loosely represents enjoyment of the five sense pleasures (e.g. sense-desire sphere). More narrowly it refers to sexual enjoyment (third of the Five Precepts). Distinguished as subjective desire (defilement) and objective things that arouse it (Nidd I 1; cf. Ch. XIV, n.36). The figure “five cords of sense desire” signifies simply these desires with the five sense objects that attract them. ^i[Rāga] (greed) is the general term for desire in its bad sense and identical with ^i[lobha,] which latter, however, appears technically as one of the three root-causes of unprofitable action. ^i[Rāga] is renderable also by “lust” in its general sense. ^i[Kāmacchanda] (lust): a technical term for the first of the five hindrances. ^i[Chanda-rāga] (zeal and greed) and ^i[kāma-rāga] (greed for sense desires) have no technical use.
^fn25 ^i[Ūhana]—“hitting upon”: possibly connected with ^i[ūhanati] (to disturb—see M I 243; II 193). Obviously connected here with the meaning of ^i[āhananapariyāhanana] (“striking and threshing”) in the next line. For the similes that follow here, see Peṭ 142.
^fn26 Of the Aṅguttara Nikāya? [The original could not be traced anywhere in the Tipiṭaka, Aṭṭhakathā, and other texts contained in the digitalised Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana edition of the Vipassana Research Institute. Dhs-a 114 quotes the same passage, but gives the source as ^i[aṭṭhakathāyaí], “in the commentary.” BPS ed.]
^fn27 These two sentences, ^i[“So hi ekaggo hutvā appeti”] and ^i[“So hi ārammaṇaí anumajjati,”] are not in Be and Ae.
^fn28 ^i[Puggalādhiṭṭhāna]—“in terms of a person”; a technical commentarial term for one of the ways of presenting a subject. They are ^i[dhammā-desanā] (discourse about principles), and ^i[puggala-desanā] (discourse about persons), both of which may be treated either as ^i[dhammādhiṭṭhāna] (in terms of principles) or ^i[puggalādhiṭṭhāna] (in terms of persons). See M-a I 24.
^fn29 The four assemblies (^i[parisā]) are the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, laymen followers and laywomen followers.
^fn30 For this word play see also XVII.48. ^i[Khaṇati] is only given in normal meaning of “to dig” in PED. There seems to be some confusion of meaning with ^i[khayati] (to destroy) here, perhaps suggested by ^i[khādati] (to eat). This suggests a rendering here and in Ch. XVII of “to consume” which makes sense. Glossed by ^i[avadāriyati,] to break or dig: not in PED. See CPD ^i[“avadārana.”]
^fn31 ^i[Kantāra-khinna]—“exhausted in a desert”; ^i[khinna] is not in PED.
^fn32 Four unities ^i[(ekatta)] are given in the preceding paragraph of the same Paṭisambhidā ref.: “The unity consisting in the appearance of relinquishment in the act of giving, which is found in those resolved upon generosity (giving up); the unity consisting in the appearance of the sign of serenity, which is found in those who devote themselves to the higher consciousness; the unity consisting in the appearance of the characteristic of fall, which is found in those with insight; the unity consisting in the appearance of cessation, which is found in noble persons” (Paṭis I 167). The second is meant here.
^fn33 “The inmates of the Abhayagiri Monastery in Anurādhapura” (Vism-mhṭ 144).
^fn34 “‘^i[Its]’: of that jhāna consciousness. ‘^i[At that moment’:] at the moment of dissolution; for when the moment of arising is past, repetition occurs starting with the moment of presence” (Vism-mhṭ 145). A curious argument; see §182.
^fn35 The quotation is incomplete and the end should read, “… ^i[ekarasaṭṭhena bhāvanāvasena paññāvasena paññindriyaí adhimattaí hoti].”
^fn36 “In the sense of the jhāna’s entire object. It is not made its partial object” (Vism-mhṭ 147).
^fn37 ^i[Kāya-duṭṭhulla—“]bodily irritability”: explained here as “bodily disturbance ^i[(daratha),] excitement of the body ^i[(kāya-sāraddhatā)”] by Vism-mhṭ (p.148); here it represents the hindrance of ill will; cf. M III 151, 159, where commented on as ^i[kāyālasiya]—“bodily inertia” (M-a IV 202, 208). PED, only gives meaning of “wicked, lewd” for ^i[duṭṭhulla], for which meaning see e.g. A I 88, Vin-a 528; cf. IX.69.
^fn38 For ^i[pamukha]—“veranda” see n. 2 above. ^i[Pariveṇa]—“surrounding space”: this meaning, not given in PED, is brought out clearly in XI.7.
^fn39 ^i[Samabbhāhata]—“stretch flat”: not in this sense in PED. This word replaces the word ^i[suvihata] used at M III 105 where this clause is borrowed from. At XI.92, the same word (apparently in another sense) is glossed by ^i[pellana] = “pushing” (not in PED) at Vism-mhṭ 362. M-a IV 153 glosses
^i[suvihata] with “^i[pasāretvā suṭṭhu vihata]” which suggests “stretched” rather than “beaten”; ^i[harati] rather than ^i[hanati].
^fn40 What the story is trying to illustrate is the rapidity with which the elder entered the jhāna, controlled its duration, and emerged, which is the necessary preliminary to the working of a marvel (the creation of a rock in this case; XII.57). The last remark seems to indicate that all the others would have been too slow (see Vism-mhṭ 150).
^fn41 See XIV.192 and note.
^fn42 In the Pali, ^i[sampasādanaí cetaso ekodibhāvaí: cetaso] (“of mind”) comes between
^i[sampasādanaí] (“confidence”) and ^i[ekodibhāvaí] (“singleness”) and so can be construed with either.
^fn43 ^i[Appita]—“done away with”:
^i[Appitā ti vināsaí gamitā] (“^i[Appita]” means “made to go to annihilation”) (Vism-mhṭ 153). This meaning, though not in PED, is given in CPD.
^fn44 ^i[Sampiṇḍana]—“conjunction”: gram. term for the word ^i[ca] (and). This meaning not given in PED. Cf. M-a I 40.
^fn45 The “eight kinds” are those connected with the eight jhānas, the “ten kinds” those connected with the four paths, the four fruitions, the void liberation, and the signless liberation.
^fn46 ^i[Avatthā—“]position, occasion.” Not in PED; see CPD.
^fn47 ^i[Sovatthika-ttaya]—”three marks;” cf. XXI.49.
^fn48 For consciousness-originated materiality see XX.30 ff.
^fn49 “They say that with the words, ‘There could be the arising of the pain faculty,’ it is shown that since grief arises even in obtainers of jhāna, it is demonstrated thereby that hate can exist without being a hindrance just as greed can; for grief does not arise without hate. Nor, they say, is there any conflict with the Paṭṭhāna text to be fancied here, since what is shown there is only grief that occurs making lost jhāna its object because the grief that occurs making its object a jhāna that has not been lost is not relevant there. And they say that it cannot be maintained that grief does not arise at all in those who have obtained jhāna since it did arise in Asita who had the eight attainments (Sn 691), and he was not one who had lost jhāna. So they say. That is wrong because there is no hate without the nature of a hindrance. If there were, it would arise in fine- material and immaterial beings, and it does not. Accordingly when in such passages as, ‘In the immaterial state, due to the hindrance of lust there is the hindrance of stiffness and torpor … the hindrance of agitation, the hindrance of ignorance’ (Paṭṭh II 291), ill will and worry are not mentioned as hindrances, that does not imply that they are not hindrances even by supposing that it was because lust, etc., were not actually hindrances and were called hindrances there figuratively because of resemblance to hindrances. And it is no reason to argue, ‘it is because it arose in Asita,’ since there is falling away from jhāna with the arising of grief. The way to regard that is that when the jhāna is lost for some trivial reason such men reinstate it without difficulty” (Vism-mhṭ 158–59).
^fn50 ^i[Gopa]—“cowherd (or guardian)”: not in PED.
^c5
^fn1 ^i[Kuṇḍika]—“a four-footed water pot”: not in PED.
^fn2 English cannot really furnish five words for water.
^fn3 ^i[Vaṇṇa-dhātu]—“colour element” should perhaps have been rendered simply by “paint.” The one Pali word “^i[nīla]” has to serve for the English blue, green, and sometimes black.
^fn4 ^i[Pattaṅga]: not in PED. ^i[Āsana]—“altar”: not in this sense in PED.
^fn5 In the Suttas the first eight kasiṇas are the same as those given here, and they are the only ones mentioned in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī (§160–203) and Paṭisambhidā (Paṭis I 6). The Suttas give space and consciousness as ninth and tenth respectively (M II 14– 15; D III 268; Netti 89, etc.). But these last two appear to coincide with the first two immaterial states, that is, boundless space and boundless consciousness. The light kasiṇa given here as ninth does not appear in the Suttas. It is perhaps a development from the “perception of light” (^i[āloka-saññā]) (A II 45). The limited-space kasiṇa given here as tenth has perhaps been made “limited’ in order to differentiate it from the first immaterial state. The commentary on the consciousness kasiṇa (M-a III 261) says nothing on this aspect. As to space, Vism-mhṭ (p. 373) says: “The attainment of the immaterial states is not produced by means of the space kasiṇa, and with the words ‘ending with the white kasiṇa’ (XXI.2) the light kasiṇa is included in the white kasiṇa.” For description of space (^i[ākāsa]) see Dhs-a 325, Netti 29. Also Vism-mhṭ (p. 393) defines space thus: “Wherever there is no obstruction, that is called space.” Again the ^i[Majjhima Nikāya ṭīkā] (commenting on MN 106) remarks: “[Sense desires] are not called empty (^i[ritta]) in the sense that space, which is entirely devoid of individual essence, is called empty.”
^fn6 The five kinds of bad kamma with immediate effect on rebirth are, in that order of priority: matricide, parricide, arahanticide, intentional shedding of a Buddha’s blood, and causing a schism in the Community, all of which cause rebirth in hell and remaining there for the remainder of the aeon (^i[kappa]), whatever other kinds of kamma may have been performed (M-a IV 109f.).
^fn7 The no-cause view, moral-inefficacy-of-action view, the nihilistic view that there is no such thing as giving, and so on (see DN 2).
^c6
^fn1 It is not possible to render such associative and alliterative derivations of meaning into English. They have nothing to do with the historical development of words, and their purpose is purely mnemonic.
^fn2 ^i[Apavārita]—“opened up”: not in PED.
^fn3 This does not imply what we, now, might suppose. See the description of “brain” in VIII.126 and especially VIII.136. What is meant is perhaps that he might get a cold or catarrh.
^fn4 Reference back to §19 requires ^i[sabhāvato upalakkhati] rather than ^i[sabhāvato vavaṭṭhāpeti], but so the readings have it.
^fn5 ^i[Vaṇita]—“inflated”: glossed by Vism-mhṭ with ^i[sūna](swollen). Not in PED in this sense.
^fn6 ^i[Vipphandana]—“wrong kind of excitement”: Vism-mhṭ says here “^i[Kilesa-paripphandanass’ eva nimittaí hotī ti attho] (the meaning is, it becomes the sign for interference by (activity of) defilement” (Vism-mhṭ 170). ^i[Phandati] and ^i[vipphandati] are both given only such meanings as “to throb, stir, twitch” and
^i[paripphandati] is not in PED. For the sense of wrong (^i[vi]-) excitement (^i[phandana]) cf. IV.89 and XIV.132 and note. There seems to be an association of meaning between ^i[vipphāra, vyāpāra, vipphandana, īhaka], and ^i[paripphandana] (perhaps also ^i[ābhoga]) in the general senses of interestedness, activity, concern, interference, intervention, etc.
^fn7 The Harvard text has ^i[ugghāṭita], but Vism-mhṭ (p. 170) reads “^i[ugghāṇitā] (not in PED) ^i[pī-tī uddhumātakabhāvappattā pi sabbaso kuthita-sarīrā-pī-ti attho].”
^fn8 “^i[Udara-pariyosānaí uparisarīram]” (Vism-mhṭ 172). ^i[Pariyosāna] here means “intensity” though normally it means “end”; but see PED ^i[pariyosita].
^fn9 There is no sense of ^i[ajjhottharati] given in PED that fits here. Cf. I.56.
^fn10 Reading ^i[ekaísena] (surely) with Harvard text rather than ^i[ekadesena] (partly).
^fn11 “He would come to handle it without disgust as a corpse-burner would” (Vism-mhṭ 176.).
^fn12 Reading ^i[manussa] with Sinhalese ed.
^fn13 ^i[Aparisaṇṭhita]—“turbulent.” ^i[Parisaṇṭhāti] (to quiet) is not in PED. ^i[Aparisaṇṭhita] is not in CPD.
^c7
^fn1 The word ^i[dhamma]—perhaps the most important and frequently used of Pali words—has no single equivalent in English because no English word has both a generalization so wide and loose as the word ^i[dhamma] in its widest sense (which includes “everything” that can be known or thought of in any way) and at the same time an ability to be, as it were, focused in a set of well-defined specific uses. Roughly ^i[dhamma] = what-can-be-remembered or what-can-be-borne-in-mind (^i[dhāretabba]) as ^i[kamma] = what-can-be-done (^i[kātabba]). The following two principal (and overlapping) senses are involved here: (i) the Law as taught, and (ii) objects of consciousness. (i) In the first case the word has either been left untranslated as “Dhamma” or “dhamma” or it has been tendered as “Law” or “law.” This ranges from the loose sense of the “Good Law,” “cosmic law,” and “teaching” to such specific technical senses as the “discrimination of law,” “causality,” “being subject to or having the nature of.” (ii) In the second case the word in its looser sense of “something known or thought of” has either been left untranslated as “dhamma” or rendered by “state” (more rarely by “thing” or “phenomenon”), while in its technical sense as one of the twelve bases or eighteen elements “mental object” and “mental datum” have been used. The sometimes indiscriminate use of “dhamma,” “state” and “law” in both the looser senses is deliberate. The English words have been reserved as far as possible for rendering ^i[dhamma] (except that “state” has sometimes been used to render ^i[bhāva], etc., in the sense of “-ness”). Other subsidiary meanings of a non-technical nature have occasionally been otherwise rendered according to context.In order to avoid muddle it is necessary to distinguish renderings of the word ^i[dhamma] and renderings of the words used to define it. The word itself is a gerundive of the verb ^i[dharati] (caus. ^i[dhāreti]—“to bear”) and so is the literal equivalent of “[quality] that is to be borne.” But since the grammatical meanings of the two words ^i[dharati] (“to bear”) and ^i[dahati] (“to put or sort out,” whence ^i[dhātu]—“element”) sometimes coalesce, it often comes very close to ^i[dhātu] (but see VIII n. 68 and XI.104). If it is asked, what bears the qualities to be borne? A correct answer here would probably be that it is the event (^i[samaya]), as stated in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī (§1, etc.), in which the various dhammas listed there arise and are present, variously related to each other. The word ^i[dhammin] (thing qualified or “bearer of what is to be borne”) is a late introduction as a logical term (perhaps first used in Pali by Vism-mhṭ, see p. 534).
As to the definitions of the word, there are several. At D-a I 99 four meanings are given: moral (meritorious) special quality (^i[guṇa]), preaching of the Law (^i[desanā]), scripture (^i[pariyatti]), and “no-living-being-ness” (^i[nissattatā]). Four meanings are also given at Dhs-a 38: scripture (^i[pariyatti]), cause (of effect) as law (^i[hetu]), moral (meritorious) special quality (^i[guṇa]), and “no-living-being-ness and soullessness” (^i[nissatta-nijjīvatā]). A wider definition is given at M-a I 17, where the following meanings are distinguished: scriptural mastery, (^i[pariyatti]—A III 86) truth, (^i[sacca]—Vin I 12) concentration, (^i[samādhi]— D II 54) understanding, (^i[paññā]—J-a I 280) nature, (^i[pakati]—M I 162) individual essence, (^i[sabhāva]—Dhs 1) voidness, (^i[suññatā]—Dhs 25) merit, (^i[puñña]—S I 82) offence, (^i[āpatti]— Vin III 187) what is knowable, (^i[ñeyya]—Paṭis II 194) “^i[and so on]” (see also VIII n. 68).
^fn2 “‘^i[Absolute confidence’] is the confidence afforded by the noble path. Development of the recollection comes to success in him who has that, not in any other” (Vism-mhṭ 181). “Absolute confidence” is a constituent of the first three “factors of stream- entry” (see S V 196).
^fn3 Cf. derivation of the word ^i[ariya] (“noble”) at M-a I 21.
^fn4 “Because of the words, ‘Also all dhammas of the three planes are sense desires (^i[kāma]) in the sense of being desirable (^i[kamanīya]) (Cf. Nidd I 1: ^i[sabbepi kāmāvacarā dhammā, sabbepi rūpāvacarā dhammā, sabbepi arūpāvacarā dhammā … kāmanīyaṭṭhena … kāmā]), greed for becoming is sense-desire clinging’ (Vism-mhṭ 184). See XII.72. For the “way to the Brahmā-world” see M II 194–96; 207f.
^fn5 Reading “^i[taí ñātaṭṭthena ñāṇaí”] with Vism-mhṭ.
^fn6 See XVII.253f. Theword ^i[bhava] is rendered here both by “existence” and by “becoming.” The former, while less awkward to the ear, is inaccurate if it is allowed a flavour of staticness. “Becoming” will be more frequently used as this work proceeds. Loosely the two senses tend to merge. But technically, “existence” should perhaps be used only for ^i[atthitā], which signifies the momentary existence of a ^i[dhamma] “possessed of the three instants of arising, presence, and dissolution.” “Becoming” then signifies the continuous flow or flux of such triple-instant moments; and it occurs in three main modes: sensual, fine-material, and immaterial. For remarks on the words “being” and “essence” see VIII n. 68.
^fn7 “Is not unobstructed knowledge (^i[anāvaraṇa-ñāṇa]) different from omniscient knowledge (^i[sabbaññuta-ñāṇa])? Otherwise the words “Six kinds of knowledge unshared [by disciples]” (Paṭis I 3) would be contradicted? [Note: The six kinds are: knowledge of what faculties prevail in beings, knowledge of the inclinations and tendencies of beings, knowledge of the Twin Marvel, knowledge of the attainment of the great compassion, omniscient knowledge, and unobstructed knowledge (see Paṭis I 133)].— There is no contradiction, because two ways in which a single kind of knowledge’s objective field occurs are described for the purpose of showing by means of this difference how it is not shared by others.
It is only one kind of knowledge; but it is called omniscient knowledge because its objective field consists of formed, unformed, and conventional (^i[sammuti]) [i.e. conceptual] dhammas without remainder, and it is called unobstructed knowledge because of its unrestricted access to the objective field, because of absence of obstruction. And it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā: “It knows all the formed and the unformed without remainder, thus it is omniscient knowledge. It has no obstruction therein, thus it is unobstructed knowledge” (Paṭis I 131), and so on. So they are not different kinds of knowledge. And there must be no reservation, otherwise it would follow that omniscient and unobstructed knowledge had obstructions and did not make all dhammas its object. There is not in fact a minimal obstruction to the Blessed One’s knowledge: and if his unobstructed knowledge did not have all dhammas as its object, there would be presence of obstruction where it did not occur, and so it would not be unobstructed.
“Or alternatively, even if we suppose that they are different, still it is omniscient knowledge itself that is intended as ‘unhindered’ since it is that which occurs unhindered universally. And it is by his attainment of that that the Blessed One is known as Omniscient, All-seer, Fully Enlightened, not because of awareness (^i[avabodha]) of every dhamma at once, simultaneously (see M II 127). And it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā: ‘This is a name derived from the final liberation of the Enlightened Ones, the Blessed Ones, together with the acquisition of omniscient knowledge at the root of the Enlightenment Tree; this name “Buddha” is a designation based on realization’ (Paṭis I 174). For the ability in the Blessed One’s continuity to penetrate all dhammas without exception was due to his having completely attained to knowledge capable of becoming aware of all dhammas.
“Here it may be asked: But how then? When this knowledge occurs, does it do so with respect to every field simultaneously, or successively? For firstly, if it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field, then with the simultaneous appearance of formed dhammas classed as past, future and present, internal and external, etc., and of unformed and conventional (conceptual) dhammas, there would be no awareness of contrast (^i[paṭibhāga]), as happens in one who looks at a painted canvas from a distance. That being so, it follows that all dhammas become the objective field of the Blessed One’s knowledge in an undifferentiated form (^i[anirūpita-rūpana]), as they do through the aspect of not-self to those who are exercising insight thus ’All dhammas are not-self’ (Dhp 279; Th 678; M I 230; II 64; S III 132; A I 286; IV 14; Paṭis II 48, 62; Vin I 86. Cf. also A III 444; IV 88, 338; Sn 1076). And those do not escape this difficulty who say that the Enlightened One’s knowledge occurs with the characteristic of presence of all knowable dhammas as its objective field, devoid of discriminative thinking (^i[vikappa-rahita]), and universal in time (^i[sabba-kāla]) and that is why they are called ’All-seeing’ and why it is said, ’The Nāga is concentrated walking and he is concentrated standing’ (?).
They do not escape the difficulty since the Blessed One’s knowledge would then have only a partial objective field, because, by having the characteristic of presence as its object, past, future and conventional dhammas, which lack that characteristic, would be absent. So it is wrong to say that it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field. Then secondly, if we say that it occurs successively with respect to every objective field, that is wrong too. For when the knowable, classed in the many different ways according to birth, place, individual essence, etc., and direction, place, time, etc., is apprehended successively, then penetration without remainder is not effected since the knowable is infinite. And those are wrong too who say that the Blessed One is All-seeing owing to his doing his defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced (^i[paccakkha]) and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning, and that such knowledge is not inferential (^i[anumānika]) since it is free from doubt, because it is what is doubtfully discovered that is meant by inferential knowledge in the world. And they are wrong because there is no such defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning, without making all of it actually experienced. For then that ‘rest’ is not actually experienced; and if it were actually experienced, it would no longer be ‘the rest.’
“All that is no argument.—Why not?—Because this is not a field for ratiocination; for the Blessed One has said this: ‘The objective field of Enlightened Ones is unthinkable, it cannot be thought out; anyone who tried to think it out would reap madness and frustration’ (A II 80). The agreed explanation here is this: Whatever the Blessed One wants to know—either entirely or partially—there his knowledge occurs as actual experience because it does so without hindrance. And it has constant concentration because of the absence of distraction. And it cannot occur in association with wishing of a kind that is due to absence from the objective field of something that he wants to know. There can be no exception to this because of the words, ‘All dhammas are available to the adverting of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, are available at his wish, are available to his attention, are available to his thought’ (Paṭis II 195). And the Blessed One’s knowledge that has the past and future as its objective field is entirely actual experience since it is devoid of assumption based on inference, tradition or conjecture.
“And yet, even in that case, suppose he wanted to know the whole in its entirety, then would his knowledge not occur without differentiation in the whole objective field simultaneously? And so there would still be no getting out of that difficulty? “That is not so, because of its purifiedness. Because the Enlightened One’s objective field is purified and it is unthinkable. Otherwise there would be no unthinkableness in the knowledge of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, if it occurred in the same way as that of ordinary people. So, although it occurs with all dhammas as its object, it nevertheless does so making those dhammas quite clearly defined, as though it had a single dhamma as its object. This is what is unthinkable here. ‘
There is as much knowledge as there is knowable, there is as much knowable as there is knowledge; the knowledge is limited by the knowable, the knowable is limited by the knowledge’ (Paṭis II l95). So he is Fully Enlightened because he has rightly and by himself discovered all dhammas together and separately, simultaneously and successively, according to his wish’ (Vism-mhṭ 190–91).
^fn8 A possessor of “the seven” has faith, conscience, shame, learning, energy, mindfulness, and understanding (see D III 252). PED traces ^i[saddhamma] (as “the true dhamma,” etc.) to ^i[sant] + ^i[dhamma]; but it is as likely traceable to ^i[srad] + ^i[dhamma] = (good ground) for the placing of faith (^i[saddhā]).
^fn9 “Here the Master’s possession of vision shows the greatness of understanding, and his possession of conduct the greatness of his compassion. It was through understanding that the Blessed One reached the kingdom of the Dhamma, and through compassion that he became the bestower of the Dhamma. It was through understanding that he felt revulsion for the round of rebirths, and through compassion that he bore it. It was through understanding that he fully understood others’ suffering, and through compassion that he undertook to counteract it. It was through understanding that he was brought face to face with Nibbāna, and through compassion that he attained it. It was through understanding that he himself crossed over, and through compassion that he brought others across. It was through understanding that he perfected the Enlightened One’s state, and through compassion that he perfected the Enlightened One’s task.
“Or it was through compassion that he faced the round of rebirths as a Bodhisatta, and through understanding that he took no delight in it. Likewise it was through compassion that he practiced non-cruelty to others, and through understanding that he was himself fearless of others. It was through compassion that he protected others to protect himself, and through understanding that he protected himself to protect others. Likewise it was through compassion that he did not torment others, and through understanding that he did not torment himself; so of the four types of persons beginning with the one who practices for his own welfare (A II 96) he perfected the fourth and best type. Likewise it was through compassion that he became the world’s helper, and through understanding that he became his own helper. It was through compassion that he had humility [as a Bodhisatta], and through understanding that he had dignity [as a Buddha]. Likewise it was through compassion that he helped all beings as a father while owing to the understanding associated with it his mind remained detached from them all, and it was through understanding that his mind remained detached from all dhammas while owing to the compassion associated with it that he was helpful to all beings. For just as the Blessed One’s compassion was devoid of sentimental affection or sorrow, so his understanding was free from the thoughts of ‘I’ and ‘mine’” (Vism-mhṭ 192–93).
^fn10 The following renderings have been adopted for the most widely-used epithets for the Buddha. ^i[Tathāgata,] (Perfect One—for definitions see M-a I 45f.) ^i[Bhagavant] (Blessed One), ^i[Sugata] (Sublime One). These renderings do not pretend to literalness. Attempts to be literal here are apt to produce a bizarre or quaint effect, and for that very reason fail to render what is in the Pali.
^fn11 ^i[Gadati]—“to enunciate”: only noun ^i[gada] in PED.
^fn12 ^i[Bhanti]—“they shine”: this form is not given in PED under ^i[bhāti].
^fn13 To take what is not self-evident in this paragraph, ^i[three kinds of feeling] are pleasant, painful and neither-painful-nor-pleasant (see MN 59). ^i[Four kinds of nutriment] are physical nutriment, contact, mental volition, and consciousness (see M I 48, and M-a I 207f.). ^i[The seven stations of consciousness] are: (1) sense sphere, (2) Brahmā’s Retinue, (3) Ābhassara (Brahmā-world) Deities, (4) Subhakiṇṇa (Brahmā-world) Deities, (5) base consisting of boundless space, (6) base consisting of boundless consciousness, (7) base consisting of nothingness (see D III 253). ^i[The eight worldly states] are gain, fame, praise, pleasure, and their opposites (see D III 260). ^i[The nine abodes of beings]: (1–4) as in stations of consciousness, (5) unconscious beings, (6–9) the four immaterial states (see D III 263). ^i[The ten bases] are eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, visible object, sound, odour, flavour, tangible object.
^fn14 ^i[Cakkavāḷa] (world-sphere or universe) is a term for the concept of a single complete universe as one of an infinite number of such universes. This concept of the cosmos, in its general form, is not peculiar to Buddhism, but appears to have been the already generally accepted one. The term ^i[loka-dhātu] (world-element), in its most restricted sense, is one world-sphere, but it can be extended to mean any number, for example, the set of world-spheres dominated by a particular Brahmā (see MN 120).
As thus conceived, a circle of “world-sphere mountains” “like the rim of a wheel” (^i[cakka]—Vism-mhṭ 198) encloses the ocean. In the centre of the ocean stands Mount Sineru (or Meru), surrounded by seven concentric rings of mountains separated by rings of sea. In the ocean between the outermost of these seven rings and the enclosing “world-sphere mountain” ring are the “four continents.”
“Over forty-two thousand leagues away” (Dhs-a 313) the moon and the sun circulate above them inside the world-sphere mountain ring, and night is the effect of the sun’s going behind Sineru. The orbits of the moon and sun are in the sense-sphere heaven of the Four Kings (^i[Catumahārājā]), the lowest heaven, which is a layer extending from the world-sphere mountains to the slopes of Sineru. The stars are on both sides of them (Dhs-a 318). Above that come the successive layers of the other five sense- sphere heavens—the four highest not touching the earth—and above them the fine-material Brahmā-worlds, the higher of which extend over more than one world- sphere (see A V 59). The world-sphere rests on water, which rests on air, which rests on space. World-spheres “lie adjacent to each other in contact like bowls, leaving a triangular unlit space between each three” (Vism-mhṭ 199), called a “world-interspace” (see too M-a IV 178). Their numbers extend thus in all four directions to infinity on the supporting water’s surface.
The southern continent of Jambudīpa is the known inhabited world (but see e.g. DN 26). Various hells (see e.g. MN 130; A V 173; Vin III 107) are below the earth’s surface. The lowest sensual-sphere heaven is that of the Deities of the Four Kings (^i[Cātumahārājika]). The four are Dhataraṭṭha Gandhabba-rāja (King of the East), Virūḷha Kumbhaṇḍa-rāja (King of the South), Virūpaka Nāga-rāja (King of the West), and Kuvera or Vessavaṇa Yakkha-rāja (King of the North—see DN 32). Here the moon and sun circulate. The deities of this heaven are often at war with the Asura demons (see e.g. D II 285) for possession of the lower slopes of Sineru. The next higher is Tāvatiísa (the Heaven of the Thirty-three), governed by Sakka, Ruler of Gods (^i[sakka-devinda]). Above this is the heaven of the Yāma Deities (Deities who have Gone to Bliss) ruled by King Suyāma (not to be confused with Yama King of the Underworld—see M III 179). Higher still come the Deities of the Tusita (Contented) Heaven with King Santusita. The fifth of these heavens is that of the Nimmānarati Deities (Deities who Delight in Creating) ruled by King Sunimmita. The last and highest of the sensual- sphere heavens is the Paranimmitavasavatti Heaven (Deities who Wield Power over Others’ Creations). Their king is Vasavatti (see A I 227; for details see Vibh-a 519f.). Māra (Death) lives in a remote part of this heaven with his hosts, like a rebel with a band of brigands (M-a I 33f.). For destruction and renewal of all this at the end of the aeon, see Ch. XIII.
^fn15 “Sineru is not only 84,000 leagues in height but measures the same in width and breadth. For this is said: ‘Bhikkhus, Sineru, king of mountains, is eighty-four thousand leagues in width and it is eighty-four thousand leagues in breadth’ (A IV 100). Each of the seven surrounding mountains is half as high as that last mentioned, that is, Yugandhara is half as high as Sineru, and so on. The great ocean gradually slopes from the foot of the world-sphere mountains down as far as the foot of Sineru, where it measures in depth as much as Sineru’s height. And Yugandhara, which is half that height, rests on the earth as Īsadhara and the rest do; for it is said: ‘Bhikkhus, the great ocean gradually slopes, gradually tends, gradually inclines’ (Ud 53). Between Sineru and Yugandhara and so on, the oceans are called ‘bottomless’ (^i[sīdanta]). Their widths correspond respectively to the heights of Sineru and the rest. The mountains stand all round Sineru, enclosing it, as it were. Yugandhara surrounds Sineru, then Īsadhara surrounds Yugandhara, and likewise with the others” (Vism-mhṭ 199).
^fn16 For the commentarial descriptions of Himavant (Himalaya) with its five peaks and seven great lakes, see M-a III 54.
^fn17 A-a commenting on A I 35 ascribes the Simbali Tree to the Supaṇṇas or winged demons. The commentary to Ud 5.5, incidentally, gives a further account of all these things, only a small portion of which are found in the Suttas.
^fn18 See note 14.
^fn19 The rendering of ^i[sadevamanussānaí] by “with its princes and men” is supported by the commentary. See M-a II 20 and also M-a I 33 where the use of ^i[sammuti-deva] for a royal personage, not an actual god is explained. ^i[Deva] is the normal mode of addressing a king. Besides, the first half of the sentence deals with deities and it would be out of place to refer to them again in the clause related to mankind.

For more on names see Dhs-a 390.
^fn23 The commentarial name for the Elder Sāriputta to whom the authorship of the Paṭisambhidā is traditionally attributed. The Paṭisambhidā text has “Buddha,” not “Bhagavā.”
^fn24 “The Niddesa method is this: ‘The word Blessed (^i[bhagavā]) is a term of respect. Moreover, he has abolished (^i[bhagga]) greed, thus he is blessed (^i[bhagavā]); he has abolished hate, … delusion, … views, … craving, … defilement, thus he is blessed.
“‘He divided (^i[bhaji]), analyzed (^i[vibhaji]), and classified (^i[paṭivibhaji]) the Dhamma treasure, thus he is blessed (^i[bhagavā]). He makes an end of the kinds of becoming (^i[bhavānaí antakaroti]), thus he is blessed (^i[bhagavā]). He has developed (^i[bhāvita]) the body and virtue and the mind and understanding, thus he is blessed (^i[bhagavā]).
“‘Or the Blessed One is a frequenter (^i[bhajī]) of remote jungle-thicket resting places with little noise, with few voices, with a lonely atmosphere, where one can lie hidden from people, favourable to retreat, thus he is blessed (^i[bhagavā]).
“‘Or the Blessed One is a partaker (^i[bhāgī]) of robes, alms food, resting place, and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, thus he is blessed (^i[bhagavā]). Or he is a partaker of the taste of meaning, the taste of the Law, the taste of deliverance, the higher virtue, the higher consciousness, the higher understanding, thus he is blessed (^i[bhagavā]). Or he is a partaker of the four jhānas, the four measureless states, the four immaterial states, thus he is blessed. Or he is a partaker of the eight liberations, the eight bases of mastery, the nine successive attainments, thus he is blessed. Or he is a partaker of the ten developments of perception, the ten kasiṇa attainments, concentration due to mindfulness of breathing, the attainment due to foulness, thus he is blessed. Or he is a partaker of the ten powers of Perfect Ones (see MN 12), of the four kinds of perfect confidence (^i[ibid]), of the four discriminations, of the six kinds of direct knowledge, of the six Enlightened Ones’ states [not shared by disciples (see note 7)], thus he is blessed. Blessed One (^i[bhagavā]): this is not a name made by a mother … This name, Blessed One, is a designation based on realization”’ (Vism-mhṭ 207).
^fn25 Here are explanations of those things in this list that cannot be discovered by reference to the index: The pairs, “anger and enmity” to “conceit and negligence (M I 16). The “three roots” are greed, hate, and delusion (D III 214). The “three kinds of misconduct” are that of body, speech, and mind (S V 75). The “three defilements” are misconduct, craving and views (Ch. I.9,13). The “three erroneous perceptions” (^i[visama-saññā]) are those connected with greed, hate, and delusion (Vibh 368). The three “applied thoughts” are thoughts of sense-desire, ill will, and cruelty (M I 114). The “three diversifications” (^i[papañca]) are those due to craving, conceit, and [false] views (XVI n. 17). “Four perversenesses”: seeing permanence, pleasure, self, and beauty, where there is none (Vibh 376). “Four cankers,” etc. (XXII.47ff.). “Five wildernesses” and “shackles” (M I 101). “Five kinds of delight”: delight in the five aggregates (XVI.93). “Six roots of discord”: anger, contempt, envy, fraud, evilness of wishes, and adherence to one’s own view (D III 246). “Nine things rooted in craving” (D III 288–89). “Ten courses of unprofitable action”: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, slander, harsh speech, gossip, covetousness, ill will, wrong view (M I 47, 286f.). “Sixty-two kinds of view”: (D I 12ff.; MN 102). “The hundred and eight ways of behaviour of craving” (Vibh 400).
^fn26 ^i[Abhigamanīya]—“fit to be relied on”: ^i[abhigacchati] not in PED.
^fn27 Vism-mhṭ says the word “^i[etc.]” includes the following six: ^i[mahimā, patti, pākamma, īsitā, vasitā], and ^i[yatthakāmāvasāyitā]. “Herein, ^i[aṇimā] means making the body minute (the size of an atom—^i[aṇu]). ^i[Laghimā] means lightness of body; walking on air, and so on. ^i[Mahimā] means enlargement producing hugeness of the body. ^i[Patti] means arriving where one wants to go. ^i[Pākamma] means producing what one wants by resolving, and so on. ^i[Isitā] means self-mastery, lordship. ^i[Vasitā] means mastery of miraculous powers. ^i[Yatthakāmāvasāyitā] means attainment of perfection in all ways in one who goes through the air or does anything else of the sort” (Vism-mhṭ 210). ^i[Yogabhāṣya] 3.45.
^fn28 The three “abidings” are these: heavenlyabiding = kasiṇa jhāna, divine abiding = loving-kindness jhāna, etc., noble abiding = fruition attainment. For the three kinds of seclusion, see IV, note 23.
^fn29 Vism-mhṭ adds seven more plays on the word ^i[bhagavā], which in brief are these: he is ^i[bhāgavā] (a possessor of parts) because he has the Dhamma aggregates of virtue, etc. (^i[bhāgā] = part, ^i[vant] = possessor of). He is ^i[bhatavā] (possessor of what is borne) because he has borne (^i[bhata]) the perfections to their full development. He has cultivated the parts (^i[bhāge vani]), that is, he has developed the various classes of attainments. He has cultivated the blessings (^i[bhage vani]), that is, the mundane and supramundane blessings. He is ^i[bhattavā](possessor of devotees) because devoted (^i[bhatta]) people show devotion (^i[bhatti]) to him on account of his attainments. He has rejected blessings (^i[bhage vami]) such as glory, lordship, fame and so on. He has rejected the parts (^i[bhāge vami]) such as the five aggregates of experience, and so on (Vism-mhṭ 241–46).
As to the word “^i[bhattavā]”: at VII.63, it is explained as “one who has frequented (^i[bhaji]) attainments.” In this sense the attainments have been “frequented” (^i[bhatta]) by him Vism-mhṭ (214 f.). uses the same word in another sense as “possessor of devotees,” expanding it as ^i[bhattā daḷhabhattikā assa bahu atthi] (“he has many devoted firm devotees”—Skr. ^i[bhakta]). In PED under ^i[bhattavant] (citing also Vism 212) only the second meaning is given. ^i[Bhatta] is from the same root (^i[bhaj]) in both cases.
For a short exposition of this recollection see commentary to AN 1:16.1.
^fn30 ^i[Anusandhi]—“sequence of meaning”: a technical commentarial term signifying both a particular subject treated in a discourse, and also the way of linking one subject with another in the same discourse. At M-a I 175 three kinds are distinguished: sequence of meaning in answer to a question (^i[pucchānusandhi]—e.g. M I 36), that to suit a personal idiosyncrasy, (^i[ajjhāsayānusandhi]—e.g. M I 23) and that due to the natural course of the teaching (^i[yathānusandhi]—e.g. the whole development of MN 6).
^fn31 ^i[Vyatti (byatti])—“particular distinction” (n. fm. ^i[vi] + ^i[añj]); not so spelt in PED but see ^i[viyatti]. Glossed by Vism-mhṭ with ^i[veyyatti].
^fn32 These “five aggregates” are those of virtue, concentration, understanding, deliverance, and knowledge and vision of deliverance.
^fn33 ^i[Vatthika]—“clothable”; not in PED.
^fn34 ^i[Pakaṭṭha]—“distant”; not in PED (= ^i[dura]—Vism-mhṭ 297).
^fn35 This passage is only loosely renderable because the exegesis here is based almost entirely on the substitution of one Pali grammatical form for another (^i[padasiddhi]). The reading ^i[opaneyyiko] (for ^i[opanayiko]) does not appear in any Sinhalese text (generally the most reliable); consequently the sentence “^i[opanayiko va opaneyyiko]” (see Harvard text) is absent in them, being superfluous. Vism-mhṭ’s explanations are incorporated. This paragraph depends on the double sense of ^i[upaneti (upa] + ^i[neti], to lead on or induce) and its derivatives as (i) an attractive inducement and (ii) a reliable guide, and so the word ^i[induce] is stretched a bit and ^i[inducive] coined on the analogy of conducive. ^i[Upanaya] (inducement) is not in PED, nor is ^i[upanayana] (inducing) in this sense (see also XIV.68). ^i[Upanayana] means in logic “application,” “subsumption”; and also ^i[upanetabba] means “to be added”; see end of §72. For ^i[allīyana] (“treating as one’s shelter”) see references in Glossary.

^fn11 “‘Person’ (^i[atta-bhāva]) is the states other than the already-mentioned life, feeling and consciousness. The words ‘^i[just these alone]’ mean that it is unmixed with self (^i[attā]) or permanence” (Vism-mhṭ 242). ^i[Atta-bhāva] as used in the Suttas and in this work is more or less a synonym for ^i[sakkāya] in the sense of person (body and mind) or personality, or individual form. See Piṭaka refs. in PED and e.g. this chapter §35 and XI.54.
“‘^i[When consciousness dissolves, the world is dead]”: just as in the case of the death-consciousness, this world is also called ‘dead’ in the highest (ultimate) sense with the arrival of any consciousness whatever at its dissolution, since its cessation has no rebirth-linking (is ‘cessation never to return’). Nevertheless, though this is so, ‘^i[the highest sense this concept will allow (paññatti paramatthiyā])’—the ultimate sense will allow this concept of continuity, which is what the expression of common usage ‘Tissa lives, Phussa lives’ refers to, and which is based on consciousnesses [momentarily] existing along with a physical support; this belongs to the ultimate sense here, since, as they say, ‘It is not the name and surname that lives.’” (Vism-mhṭ 242, 801)
Something may be said about the word ^i[paññatti] here. Twenty-four kinds are dealt with in the commentary to the Puggalapaññatti. The Puggalapaññatti Schedule (^i[mātikā]) gives the following six ^i[paññatti] (here a making known, a setting out): of aggregates, bases, elements, truths, faculties, and persons. (Pug 1) The commentary explains the word in this sense as ^i[paññāpana] (making known) and ^i[ṭhapana] (placing), quoting “He announces, teaches, declares (^i[paññāpeti]), establishes” (cf. M III 248), and also “a well-appointed (^i[supaññatta]) bed and chair” (?). It continues: “The making known of a name (^i[nāma-paññatti]) shows such and such dhammas and places them in such and such compartments, while the making known of the aggregates (^i[khandha-paññatti]) and the rest shows in brief the individual form of those making-known (^i[paññatti]).”
It then gives six kinds of ^i[paññatti] “according to the commentarial method but not in the texts”: (1) ^i[Concept of the existent (vijjamāna-paññatti]), which is the conceptualizing of (making known) a dhamma that is existent, actual, become, in the true and ultimate sense (e.g. aggregates, etc.). (2) ^i[Concept of the non-existent], which is, for example, the conceptualizing of “female,” “male,” “persons,” etc., which are non-existent by that standard and are only established by means of current speech in the world; similarly “such impossibilities as concepts of a fifth truth or the other sectarians’ Atom, Primordial Essence, World Soul, and the like.” (3) ^i[Concept of the non-existent based on the existent], e.g. the expression, “One with the three clear-visions,” where the “person” (“one”) is nonexistent and the “clear-visions” are existent. (4) ^i[Concept of the existent based on the non-existent], e.g. the “female form,” “visible form” (= visible datum base) being existent and “female” non-existent. (5) ^i[Concept of the existent] based on the existent, e.g. “eye-contact,” both “eye” and “contact” being existent. (6) ^i[Concept of the non-existent based on the non-existent], e.g. “banker’s son,” both being non-existent.
Again two more sets of six are given as “according to the Teachers, but not in the Commentaries.” The first is: (1) ^i[Derivative concept (upādā-paññatti]); this, for instance, is a “being,” which is a convention derived from the aggregates of materiality, feeling, etc., though it has no individual essence of its own apprehendable in the true ultimate sense, as materiality, say, has in its self-identity and its otherness from feeling, etc.; or a “house” or a “fist” or an “oven” as apart from its component parts, or a “pitcher” or a “garment,” which are all derived from those same aggregates; or “time” or “direction,” which are derived from the revolutions of the moon and sun; or the “learning sign” or “counterpart sign” founded on some aspect or other, which are a convention derived from some real sign as a benefit of meditative development: these are derived concepts, and this kind is a “concept” (^i[paññatti]) in the sense of “ability to be set up” (^i[paññāpetabba] = ability to be conceptualized), but not in the sense of “making known” (^i[paññāpana]). Under the latter heading this would be a “concept of the nonexistent.” (2) ^i[Appositional concept (upa-nidhā-p].): many varieties are listed, namely, apposition of reference (“second” as against “first,” “third” as against “second,” “long” as against “short”); apposition of what is in the hand (“umbrella-in-hand,” “knife-in-hand”); apposition of association (“earring-wearer,” “topknot-wearer,” “crest-wearer”); apposition of contents (“corn-wagon,” “ghee-pot”); apposition of proximity (“Indasālā Cave,” “Piyaṅgu Cave”); apposition of comparison (“golden coloured,” “with a bull’s gait”); apposition of majority (“Padumassara-brahman Village”); apposition of distinction (“diamond ring”); and so on. (3) ^i[Collective concept (samodhāna-p].), e.g., “eight-footed,” “pile of riches.” (4) ^i[Additive concept (upanikkhitta- p].), e.g. “one,” “two,” “three.” (5) ^i[Verisimilar concept (tajjā-p].): refers to the individual essence of a given dhamma, e.g. “earth,” “fire,” “hardness,” “heat.” (6) ^i[Continuity concept(santati-p].): refers to the length of continuity of life, e.g. “octogenarian,” “nonagenarian.”
In the second set there are: (i) ^i[Concept according to function (kicca-p].), e.g. “preacher,” “expounder of Dhamma.” (ii) ^i[Concept according to shape (saṇṭhāna-p.]), e.g. “thin,” “stout,” “round,” “square.” (iii) ^i[Concept according to gender (liṅga-p].), e.g. “female,” “male.” (iv) ^i[Concept according to location (bhūmi-p].), e.g. “of the sense sphere,” “Kosalan.” (v) ^i[Concept as proper name (paccatta-p].), e.g. “Tissa,” “Nāga,” “Sumana,” which are making-known (appellations) by mere name-making. (vi) ^i[Concept of the unformed (asaṅkhata-paññatti]), e.g. “cessation,” “Nibbāna,” etc., which make the unformed dhamma known—an existent concept. (From commentary to ^i[Puggalapaññatti], condensed—see also Dhs-a 390f.)
All this shows that the word ^i[paññatti] carries the meanings of either appellation or concept or both together, and that no English word quite corresponds.
^fn12 “‘But since the object is stated with individual essences’: the breakup of states with individual essences, their destruction, their fall—[all] that has to do only with states with individual essences. Hence the Blessed One said: ‘Bhikkhus, aging-and- death is impermanent, formed, dependently arisen’ (S II 26). … If it cannot reach absorption because of [its object being] states with individual essences then what about the supramundane jhānas and certain of the immaterial jhānas? It was to answer this that he said ‘now with special development the supramundane jhāna’ and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 243). Kasiṇa jhāna, for example, has a concept (^i[paññatti]) as its object (IV.29) and a concept is a dhamma without individual essence (^i[asabhāva-dhamma]).
^fn13 In the Aṅguttara text the negative and positive clauses are in the opposite order.
^fn14 ^i[Agaru]—“aloes”: not so spelled in PED; but see ^i[agalu].
^fn15 ^i[Hatthasaṅkhalikā]—“the fingers of a pair of clasped hands,” “a row of fingers (^i[aṅgulīpanti]) (Vism-mhṭ 246).
^fn16 “For the penetration of the characteristic of foulness, for the observation of repulsiveness as the individual essence” (Vism-mhṭ 246).
^fn17 “The higher consciousness” is a term for jhāna.
^fn18 Vism-mhṭ explains “^i[sati sati āyatane]” (rendered here by “whenever there is occasion” with “^i[tasmií tasmií pubbahetu-ādi-kāraṇe sati]” (“when there is this or that reason consisting in a previous cause, etc.”); M-a IV 146 says: “^i[Sati sati kāraṇe. Kim pan’ ettha kāraṇan’ti. Abhiññā’ va kāraṇaí] (‘Whenever there is a reason. But what is the reason here? The direct-knowledge itself is the reason’).”
^fn19 ^i[Ariṭṭhaka] as a plant is not in PED; see CPD—Sinh ^i[penela uṭa].
^fn20 There are various readings.
^fn21 “^i[Galavāṭaka],” here rendered by “nape of the neck,” which the context demands. But elsewhere (e.g. IV.47, VIII.110) “base of the neck” seems indicated, that is, where the neck fits on to the body, or “gullet.”
^fn22 A measure of length, as much as a “louse’s head.”
^fn23 ^i[Nisadapota]—“^i[rolling pin]”: (= ^i[silā-puttaka]—Vism-mhṭ 250) What is meant is probably the stone roller, thicker in the middle than at the ends, with which curry spices, etc., are normally rolled by hand on a small stone slab in Sri Lanka today.
^fn24 ^i[Koṭṭhaṭṭhīni]—“shoulder-blade bones”: for ^i[koṭṭha] (=flat) cf. ^i[koṭṭhalika] §97; the meaning is demanded by the context, otherwise no mention would be made of these two bones, and the description fits. PED under this ref. has “stomach bone” (?). Should one read ^i[a-tikhiṇa] (blunt) or ^i[ati-khiṇa] (very sharp)?
^fn25 ^i[Duttacchita]—“badly pared”: ^i[tacchita], pp. of ^i[tacchati] to pare (e.g. with an adze); not in PED; see M I 31,124; III 166.
^fn26 ^i[Pañjara]—“frame”: not quite in this sense in PED.
^fn27 ^i[Saṅkuṭitaghaṭapuṇṇapaṭalakhaṇḍa]—“a piece of curled-up toffee flake.” The Sinhalese translation suggests the following readings and resolution: ^i[saṅkuthita] (thickened or boiled down (?), rather than ^i[saṅkuṭita], curled up); ^i[ghata-puṇṇa] ([toffee?] “full of ghee”); ^i[paṭala] (flake or slab); ^i[khaṇḍa] (piece).
^fn28 ^i[Kilomaka]—“midriff”: the rendering is obviously quite inadequate for what is described here, but there is no appropriate English word.
^fn29 ^i[Obhagga]—“looped”: not in this sense in PED; see ^i[obhañjati] (XI.64 and PED).
^fn30 ^i[Dakasītalika]: not in PED; rendered in Sinhalese translation by ^i[helmaeli] (white edible water lily).
^fn31 ^i[Maísaka-sambupali-veṭhana-kiliṭṭha-pāvāra-pupphaka-sadisa]: this is rendered into Sinhalese by ^i[kuṇu mas kasaḷa velu por&otilde;nā kaḍek pup] (“an inflated piece (or bag) of cloth, which has wrapped rotten meat refuse”). In PED ^i[pāvāra] is given as “cloak, mantle” and (this ref.) as “the mango tree”; but there seems to be no authority for the rendering “mango tree,” which has nothing to do with this context. ^i[Pupphaka] (balloon) is not in PED (cf. common Burmese spelling of ^i[bubbuḷa] (bubble) as ^i[pupphuḷa]).
^fn32 It would be a mistake to take the renderings of these worms’ names too literally. ^i[Gaṇḍuppada] (boil-producing worm?) appears only as “earth worm” in PED, which will not do here. The more generally accepted reading seems to take ^i[paṭatantuka] and ^i[suttaka] (tape-worm and thread-worm) as two kinds rather than ^i[paṭatantusuttaka]; neither is in PED.
^fn33 ^i[Kuṇapa]—“ordure”; PED only gives the meaning “corpse,” which does not fit the meaning either here or, e.g., at XI.21, where the sense of a dead body is inappropriate.
^fn34 ^i[Kaṇḍūyati]—“to itch”: the verb is not in PED; see ^i[kaṇḍu].
^fn35 ^i[Upādiṇṇa]—“clung-to”: see Ch. XIV, note 23.
^fn36 Reference is sometimes made to the “hand-grasping question” (^i[hattha-gahaka pañhā]). It may be to this; but there is another mentioned at the end of the commentary to the Dhātu-Vibhaṅga.
^fn37 The allusion seems to be to the bases of mastery (^i[abhibhāyatana]—or better, bases for transcendence); see M II l3 and M-a III 257f.; but see §60.
^fn38 “‘Some’ is said with reference to the inmates of the Uttara (Northern) monastery [in Anurādhapura]” (Vism-mhṭ 256).
^fn39 “The words ‘in all its aspects’ refer to the sixteen bases; for these are only found in total in this dispensation. When outsiders know mindfulness of breathing they only know the first four modes” (Vism-mhṭ 257).
^fn40 “‘The ascetic’ is a stream-enterer, the ‘second ascetic’ is a once-returner, the ‘third ascetic’ is a non-returner, the ‘fourth ascetic’ is an Arahant” (M-a II 4).
^fn41 ^i[Kūṭa]—“wild”: PED, this ref. gives “useless,” which misses the point. Cf. M-a II 82; IV 198.
^fn42 The nine kinds of abode (resting place) are the forest and the root of a tree already mentioned, and a rock, a hill cleft, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw (M I 181).
^fn43 “In the hot season the forest is favourable, in the cold season the root of a tree, in the rainy season an empty place. For one of phlegmatic humour, phlegmatic by nature, the forest is favourable, for one of bilious humour the root of a tree, for one of windy humour an empty place. For one of deluded temperament the forest, for one of hating temperament the root of a tree, for one of greedy temperament an empty place” (Vism-mhṭ 258).
^fn44 The amplification is from Vism-mhṭ 258.
^fn45 “‘Regarded as particles’: as a number of groups (^i[kalāpa])” (Vism-mhṭ 259). This conception of the occurrence of breaths is based on the theory of motion as “successive arisings in adjacent locations” (^i[desantaruppatti]); see note 54 below. For “groups” see XX.2f.
^fn46 “‘Zeal arises’: additional zeal, which is profitable and has the characteristic of desire to act, arises due to the satisfaction obtained when the meditation has brought progressive improvement. ‘More subtle than before’: more subtle than before the already-described zeal arose; for the breaths occur more subtly owing to the meditation’s influence in tranquilizing the body’s distress and disturbance. ‘Gladness arises’: fresh happiness arises of the kinds classed as minor, etc., which is the gladness that accompanies the consciousness occupied with the meditation and is due to the fact that the peacefulness of the object increases with the growing subtlety of the breaths and to the fact that the meditation subject keeps to its course. ‘The mind turns away’: the mind turns away from the breaths, which have reached the point at which their manifestation needs investigating (see §177) owing to their gradually increasing subtlety. But some say (see Paṭis-a Ce, p. 351): ‘It is when the in-breaths and out- breaths have reached a subtler state owing to the influence of the meditation and the counterpart sign; for when that has arisen, the mind turns away from the normal breaths.’ ‘Equanimity is established’: when concentration, classed as access and absorption, has arisen in that counterpart sign, then, since there is no need for further interest to achieve jhāna, onlooking (equanimity) ensues, which is specific neutrality” (Vism-mhṭ 260).
^fn47 “‘In these nine ways’: that occur in the nine ways just described. ‘Long in-breaths and out-breaths are a body’: the in-breaths and out-breaths, which exist as particles though they have the aspect of length, constitute a ‘body’ in the sense of a mass. And here the sign that arises with the breaths as its support is also called ‘in-breath and out-breath.’ (cf. e.g. §206) ‘The establishment (foundation) is mindfulness’: mindfulness is called ‘establishment (foundation)—(^i[upaṭṭhāna])’ since it approaches (^i[upagantvā]) the object and remains (^i[tiṭṭhati]) there. ‘The contemplation is knowledge’: contemplation of the sign by means of serenity, and contemplation of mentality-materiality by defining with insight the in-breaths and out-breaths and the body, which is their support, as materiality, and the consciousness and the states associated with it as the immaterial (mentality), are knowledge, in other words, awareness of what is actually there (has actually become). ‘The body is the establishment (foundation)’: there is that body, and mindfulness approaches it by making it its object and remains there, thus it is called ‘establishment.’ And the words ‘the body is the establishment’ include the other (the mental) kind of body too since the above-mentioned comprehension by insight is needed here too. ‘But it is not the mindfulness’: that body is not called ‘mindfulness’ [though it is called ‘the establishment’]. ‘Mindfulness is both the establishment (foundation) and the mindfulness,’ being so both in the sense of remembering (^i[sarana]) and in the sense of establishing (^i[upatiṭṭhana]). ‘By means of that mindfulness’: by means of that mindfulness already mentioned. ‘And that knowledge’: and the knowledge already mentioned. ‘That body’: that in-breath-and-out-breath body and that material body which is its support. ‘He contemplates (^i[anupassati])’: he keeps re- seeing (^i[anu anu passati]) with jhāna knowledge and with insight knowledge. ‘That is why “Development of the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body” is said’: in virtue of that contemplation this is said to be development of the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body of the kind already stated. What is meant is this: the contemplation of the body as an in-breath-and-out-breath body as stated and of the physical body that is its [material] support, which is not contemplation of permanence, etc., in a body whose individual essence is impermanent, etc.—like the contemplation of a waterless mirage as water—but which is rather contemplation of its essence as impermanent, painful, not-self, and foul, according as is appropriate, or alternatively, which is contemplation of it as a mere body only, by not contemplating it as containing anything that can be apprehended as ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘woman’ or ‘man’—all this is ‘contemplation of the body.’ The mindfulness associated with that contemplation of the body, which mindfulness is itself the establishment, is the ‘establishment.’ The development, the increase, of that is the ‘development of the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body.’” (Vism-mhṭ 261)
The compound ^i[satipaṭṭhāna] is derived by the Paṭisambhidā from ^i[sati] (mindfulness) and ^i[upaṭṭhāna] (establishment—Paṭis I 182), but in the Commentaries the resolution into ^i[sati] and ^i[paṭṭhāna] (foundation) is preferred. (M-a I 237–38) In the 118th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya the first tetrad is called development of the first foundation of mindfulness, or contemplation of the body. (MN 10; DN 22) The object of the Paṭisambhidā passage quoted is to demonstrate this.
^fn48 The beginning, middle and end are described in §197, and the way they should be treated is given in §199–201. What is meant is that the meditator should know what they are and be aware of them without his mindfulness leaving the tip of the nose to follow after the breaths inside the body or outside it, speculating on what becomes of them.
^fn49 “‘In the first part of the system’: in the first part of the system of development; in the first two bases, is what is intended. Of course, arousing of knowledge must be admitted to take place here too because of the presence of awareness of the length and shortness of the breaths as they actually are (as they actually become); and it is not hard to do that, for it is merely the taking account of them as they occur. That is why it is put in the present tense here. But what follows is as hard as for a man to walk on a razor’s edge; which is why the future tense is used for the subsequent stages in order to indicate the need for exceptional prior effort” (Vism-mhṭ 263).
^fn50 “‘Bodily formation’: the in-breath and out-breath (see M I 301). For although it is consciousness-originated, it is nevertheless called ‘bodily formation’ since its existence is bound up with the kamma-born body and it is formed with that as the means” (Vism-mhṭ 263).
^fn51 “The faint sound itself as a sign is the ‘sign of the faint sounds’; it has that as its object. What is meant? Of course, the faint sounds have ceased too then; but the sign of the sounds has been well apprehended and so consciousness occurs with the sign of fainter sounds as its object. For as from the outset he ascertains with undistracted consciousness the sign of each sound as it ceases, eventually his consciousness occurs in the end with the sign of ultra-subtle sounds too as its object” (Vism-mhṭ 266).
^fn52 “As a meditation subject for a beginner” is said with reference to the serenity (i.e. jhāna) meditation subject; but the insight meditation subject applies to the other tetrads too” (Vism-mhṭ 266).
^fn53 “‘Buffeted by wind’: if he gives much attention to the wind that has gone inside, that place seems to him as if it were buffeted by the wind, as if filled with fat” (Vism- mhṭ 268). No further explanation is given.
^fn54 “‘Following (^i[anugamana])’ is occurring along with (^i[anu anu pavattana]), going after (^i[anugacchana]), by means of mindfulness through making the breaths the object as they occur, Hence he said, ‘And that is not by following after the beginning, middle and end.’ ‘The navel is the beginning’ because of their first arising there. For the notion of a beginning (^i[ādi cintā]) is here in the sense of first arising, not in the sense of just arising [once only]. For they actually go on arising throughout [the whole length] from the navel to the nose-tip; and wherever they arise, there in that same place they dissolve, because there is no going (movement) of dhammas. The ordinary term ‘motion’ (^i[gatisamaññā]) refers to successive arisings in adjacent locations (^i[desantaruppatti]) according to conditions. ‘The heart is the middle’: near the heart, just above it is the middle. ‘The nose tip is the end’: the place where the nostrils are is the end; that is the limit of the application of the ordinary term ‘in-breaths and out-breaths,’ for it is accordingly that they are called ‘consciousness-originated,’ there being no production externally of what is consciousness-originated” (Vism-mhṭ 268).

^fn56 Reading ^i[āgata-gata-vasena] with Vism-mhṭ 271.
^fn57 The point made here is that if the breaths themselves get temporarily too faint to be observed, he should carry on by observing the tip of the nose where they normally touch until they become apparent again. He brings the meditation back to mind for the moment, “as the place (^i[desato])” where they were last noticed, instead of “as breaths,” which have temporarily vanished.

^fn59 “‘The sign’ is the learning sign and the counterpart sign, for both are stated here together. Herein, the three similes beginning with cotton are properly the learning sign, the rest are both. ‘Some’ are certain teachers. The similes beginning with the ‘cluster of gems’ are properly the counterpart sign” (Vism-mhṭ 273).
^fn60 “‘Because of difference in perception’: because of the difference in the manner of perceiving that occurred before the arising of the sign” (Vism-mhṭ 273).
^fn61 ^i[Vibhāvayaí] can mean “to do away with” or “to explain.” Either is applicable here according to Vism-mhṭ 274.
^fn62 For the Wheel-turning Monarch (^i[cakkavattin]) see DN 26 and MN 129.
^fn63 “‘With the object’: under the heading of the object. The happiness included in the jhāna that has that object is experienced ‘because of the experiencing of the object.’ What is meant? Just as, when a man who is looking for a snake discovers (experiences) its abode, the snake is, as it were, already discovered (experienced) and caught, owing to the ease with which he will then be able to catch it with charms and spells, so too, when the object, which is the abode of the happiness, is experienced (discovered), then the happiness itself is experienced (discovered) too, owing to the ease with which it will be apprehended in its specific and general characteristics. ‘By his penetration of its characteristics’: by penetration of the specific and general characteristics of happiness. For when the specific and general characteristics of anything are experienced then that thing is experienced according to reality” (Vism-mhṭ 276).
^fn64 “‘Momentary unification of the mind’: concentration lasting only for a moment. For that too, when it occurs uninterruptedly on its object in a single mode and is not overcome by opposition, fixes the mind immovably, as if in absorption” (Vism-mhṭ 278).
^fn65 “‘Delivering’: secluding, separating, by means of deliverance consisting in suppression; abandoning the hindrances, is the meaning. ‘At the actual time of insight’: at the time of contemplation of dissolution. For dissolution is the furthest extreme of impermanence. So the meditator who is contemplating dissolution by its means sees under the heading of consciousness the whole field of formations as impermanent, not as permanent; and because of the suffering inherent in what is impermanent, and because of the absence of self in what is painful, he sees that same whole field of formations as painful, not as pleasant, and as not-self, not as self. But since what is impermanent, painful, and not-self is not something to delight in, and what is not something to delight in is not something to be greedy for, consequently he becomes dispassionate towards that whole field of formations when it is seen in the light of dissolution as impermanent, painful, not-self, he does not delight in it, and his greed for it fades away, does not dye him. Now, as he thus becomes dispassionate and his greed fades away, it is firstly by means of mundane knowledge only that he causes greed to cease and does not arouse it. The meaning is that he does not bring about its arising. Or alternatively, his greed having thus faded away, he causes by means of his own knowledge the cessation of the unseen field of formations just as that of the seen, he does not arouse it; the meaning is that he brings about only its cessation, he does not bring about its arising. Having entered on this way, he relinquishes, he does not grasp. What is meant? It is that this contemplation of impermanence, etc., is called relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into because it gives up defilements along with aggregate- producing kamma-formations and because, by seeing the flaws in what is formed and by inclining towards the opposite of what is formed, namely Nibbāna, it enters into that Nibbāna. Consequently the meditator who has that contemplation gives up defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way stated. Herein, the contemplation of what is impermanent as only impermanent is ‘contemplation of impermanence’; this is a name for insight that occurs by taking formations of the three [mundane] planes [and leaving aside the supramundane] as impermanent. ‘From the perception of permanence’: from the wrong perception that occurs perceiving formed things as permanent, eternal; also the various views should be regarded as included under the heading of perception. Likewise with the perception of pleasure and so on. ‘By means of the contemplation of dispassion’: by means of the contemplation that occurs in the mode of dispassion for formations. ‘From delight’: from craving accompanied by happiness. ‘By means of the contemplation of fading away’: by means of the contemplation that occurs similarly in the mode of fading away; hence ‘delivering from greed’ is said. ‘By means of the contemplation of cessation’: by means of the successive seeing of formations’ cessation. Or contemplating cessation is contemplation such that formations cease only and do not arise with future renewal. For this is knowledge of desire for deliverance grown strong. Hence he said, ‘delivering from arousing.’ Contemplation that occurs in the mode of relinquishing is ‘contemplation of relinquishment.’ ‘From grasping’: from taking as permanent, etc.; or the meaning can also here be regarded as ‘from grasping rebirth-linking.’ (Vism-mhṭ 279) See Chapters XX and XXI.
^fn66 “What is called ‘permanent’ is what is lasting, eternal, like Nibbāna. What is called ‘impermanent’ is what is not permanent, and is possessed of rise and fall. He said ‘The five aggregates are “the impermanent,’” signifying that they are formed dhammas as to meaning. Why? ‘Because their essence is rise and fall and change’: the meaning is that their individual essences have rise and fall and change. Herein, formed dhammas’ arising owing to cause and condition, their coming to be after non-existence, their acquisition of an individual self (^i[attalābha]), is ‘rise.’ Their momentary cessation when arisen is ‘fall.’
^fn67 “‘Destruction’ is the vanishing of formations; it is the act of those formations’ fading away, their disintegration, that is ‘fading away.’ Destruction itself as fading away is ‘fading away as destruction’; this is momentary cessation. Formations fade away absolutely here when this has been reached, thus it is ‘absolute fading away;’ this is Nibbāna” (Vism-mhṭ 280).
^fn68 “The act of relinquishing as the act of giving up by means of substituting for what should be abandoned its opposite quality or by cutting it off, is ‘relinquishment as giving up.’ Likewise the act of relinquishing of self that takes place in non-formation of kamma, which is the relinquishing of all substrata (circumstances) of becoming, being the entering into that [Nibbāna] either by inclination towards it [in insight] or by having it as object [in the path] is ‘relinquishment as entering into.’ ‘Through substitution of opposite qualities’: here contemplation of impermanence, firstly, gives up perception of permanence by abandoning through substitution of the opposite [e.g. substituting perception of impermanence for that of permanence in the case of all formed things]. And the giving up in this way is in the form of inducing non-occurrence. For all kamma-formations that are rooted in defilements due to apprehending (formations) as permanent, and the kamma-resultant aggregates rooted in both which might arise in the future, are abandoned by causing their non-occurrence. Likewise in the case of perception of pain, and so on. ‘Through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed’: through seeing the fault of impermanence, etc., in the formed three-plane field of formations. It is ‘the opposite of the formed’ owing to its permanence, and so on. When defilements are given up by the path, then kamma-formations are called ‘given up’ through producing (^i[āpādana]) in them the nature of not causing result, and aggregates rooted in them are called ‘given up’ through their being rendered fit for non-arising. So the path gives up all these, is what is meant” (Vism-mhṭ 281). The word ^i[pakkhandana] (rendered by “entering into”) is used to define the act of faith, and can also be rendered by “launching out into” or by “leap.”
^fn69 “In such passages as ‘Dhammas that are concepts’ (Dhs p. 1, §1308) even a non- entity (^i[abhāva]) is thus called a ‘dhamma’ since it is borne (^i[dhārīyati]) and affirmed (^i[avadhārīyati]) by knowledge. That kind of dhamma is excluded by his saying, ^i[‘Dhammas [means] individual essences.’] The act of becoming (^i[bhavana]), which constitutes existing- ness (^i[vijjamānatā]) in the ultimate sense, is essence (^i[bhāva]); it is with essence (^i[saha bhāvena]), thus it is an individual essence (^i[sabhāva]); the meaning is that it is possible (^i[labbhamānarūpa]) in the true sense, in the ultimate sense. For these are called ‘dhammas (bearers)’ because they bear (^i[dhāraṇa]) their own individual essences (^i[sabhāva]), and they are called ‘individual essences’ in the sense already explained” (Vism-mhṭ 282; cf. Ch. VII, n. 1).
In the Piṭakas the word^i[sabhāva] seems to appear only once (Paṭis II 178). It next appears in the Netti (p.79), the ^i[Milindapañhā] (pp. 90, 164, 212, 360). It is extensively used for exegetical purposes in the ^i[Visuddhimagga] and main commentaries and likewise in the subcommentaries. As has just been shown, it is narrower than dhamma (see also Ch. XXIII. n. 18). It often roughly corresponds to ^i[dhātu] (element—see e.g. Dhs-a 263) and to ^i[lakkhaṇa] (characteristic—see below), but less nearly to the vaguer and (in Pali) untechnical ^i[pakati] (nature), or to ^i[rasa] (function—see I.21). The ^i[Atthasālinī] observes: “It is the individual essence, or the generality, of such and such dhammas that is called their characteristic” (Dhs-a 63); on which the ^i[Mūla ṭīkā] comments: “The ^i[individual essence] consisting in, say, hardness as that of earth, or touching as that of contact, is not common to all dhammas. The ^i[generality] is the individual essence common to all consisting in impermanence, etc.; also in this context (i.e. Dhs §1) the characteristic of being profitable may be regarded as general because it is the individual ^i[essence] common to all that is profitable; or alternatively it is their individual ^i[essence] because it is not common to the unprofitable and indeterminate [kinds of consciousness]” (Dhs- a 63). The individual ^i[essence] of any formed dhamma is manifested in the three instants of its existence (^i[atthitā, vijjamānatā]), namely, arising, presence (= aging) and dissolution. It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere (XV.15) and is borne by the mind. Dhammas without individual essence (^i[asabhāvadhamma]) include the attainment of cessation (see Ch. XXIII, n. 18) and some concepts. Space and time belong to the last-mentioned. Of space (^i[ākāsa]) the ^i[Majjhima Nikāya ṭīkā] says: “Space, which is quite devoid of individual essence, is called empty” (commenting on MN 106), while of time (^i[kāla]) the ^i[Mūla ṭīkā] says: “Though time is determined by the kind of consciousness [e.g. as specified in the first paragraph of the Dhammasaṅgaṇī] and is non-existent (^i[avijjamāna]) as to individual essence, yet as the non-entity (^i[abhāva]) before and after the moment in which those [conascent and co-present] dhammas occur, it is called the ‘container (^i[adhikaraṇa])’; it is perceived (symbolized) only as the state of a receptacle (^i[ādhāra-bhāva]) (Dhs-a 62). Of Nibbāna (for which see XVI.46ff.), which has its own individual essence, the ^i[Mūla ṭīkā] says “Nibbāna is not like other dhammas; because of its extreme profundity it cannot be made an object of consciousness (^i[ālambituí]) by one who has not realized it. That is why it has to be realized by change-of-lineage. It has profundity surpassing any individual essence belonging to the three periods of time” (Vibh-a 38).
^i[Sabhāva] has not the extreme vagueness of its parent ^i[bhāva,] which can mean anything between “essence” (see e.g. Dhs-a 61) and “-ness” (e.g. ^i[natthibhāva] = non-existingness— X.35). This may be remembered when ^i[sabhāva] is defined as above thus: “It is with essence (^i[sahabhāvena]), thus it is individual essence (^i[sabhāva])” (Vism-mhṭ 282), and when it is defined again thus: “A dhamma’s own essence or its existing essence (^i[sako vā bhāvo samāno vā bhāvo]) is its individual essence (^i[sabhāva])” (Vism-mhṭ 433). ^i[Sabhāva] can also be the basis of a wrong view, if regarded as the sole efficient cause or condition of any formed thing (Ch. XVI, n.23). The Sanskrit equivalent, ^i[svabhāva], had a great vogue and checkered history in philosophical discussions on the Indian mainland.
This (unlike the word, ^i[dhamma,] which has many “referents”) is an instance in which it is of first importance to stick to one rendering. The word is a purely exegetical one; consequently vagueness is undesirable. “Individual essence” has been chosen principally on etymological grounds, and the word “essence” (an admittedly slippery customer) must be understood from the contexts in which it is used and not prejudged. Strictly it refers here to the triple moment of arising etc., of formed dhammas that can have such “existence” in their own right and be experienced as such; and it refers to the realizability of Nibbāna. We are here in the somewhat magical territory of ontology, a subject that is at present undergoing one of its periodical upheavals in Europe, this time in the hands of the existentialists. Consequently it is important to approach the subject with an open mind.
^fn70 “‘Made’ is generated. ‘Not so made’ is not made by any conditions at all.” (Vism-mhṭ 281)
^fn71 “That dhamma possessing individual essence and having the characteristic of being not formed is to be treated basically as ‘fading away,’ since it is there that the dhamma of defilement fades away” (Vism-mhṭ 282).
^fn72 “When they are being abandoned by the noble path, which occurs by making Nibbāna its object, it is said that they are abandoned by reaching that [Nibbāna] which is why he said, ‘Because on coming to it,’ and so on. Herein, ‘vanity of conceit (^i[māna- mada])’ is conceit (^i[māna]) that occurs as conceiving (^i[maññanā]) ‘I am superior’ (Vibh 353). ‘Vanity of manhood’ is vanity about being of the male sex. The words ‘such as’ refer to vanity of birth, and so on (Vibh 345)” (Vism-mhṭ 282).
^fn73 Modern etymology derives the word Nibbāna (Skr. ^i[nirvāṇa]) from the negative prefix ^i[nir] plus the root ^i[vā] (to blow). The original literal meaning was probably “extinction” of a fire by ceasing to blow on it with bellows (a smith’s fire for example). It seems to have been extended to extinction of fire by any means, for example, the going out of a lamp’s flame (^i[nibbāyati]—M III 245). By analogy it was extended to the extinction of the five-aggregate process on the Arahant’s death (see It 38). Nibbāna is not the “extinction of a self or of a living lasting being,” such a mistaken opinion being the annihilation view (see e.g. M I 140, S III 109).
^fn74 Some texts add ^i[leṇa] (another word for shelter). Still others are given in the Saíyutta text.

^fn1 “‘Fighting against the wall’: having undertaken the precepts of virtue and sat down on a seat in his room with the door locked, he was developing loving-kindness. Blinded by lust arisen under cover of the loving-kindness, he wanted to go to his wife, and without noticing the door he beat on the wall in his desire to get out even by breaking the wall down” (Vism-mhṭ 286).
^fn2 Reading ^i[dāna-piyavacanādīni] with Ce (see four ^i[saṅgahavatthūni]—A II 32).
^fn3 The Aṅguttara text has “Let him … reappear in a state of loss” and so on.
^fn4 “The eight great hells beginning with that of Sañjīva (see J-a V 266, 270). At each of the four doors of the Great Unmitigated (^i[Avīci]) Hell there are the four beginning with the Ember (^i[Kukuḷa]) Hell (M III 185), which make up the sixteen prominent hells” (Vism-mhṭ 291).
^fn5 ^i[Saṅku-patha]—“set on piles”: Vism-mhṭ (p. 294) says: “^i[Saṅku laggāpetvā te ālambhitvā gamanamaggo saṅkupatho.]” This disagrees with PED for this ref.
^fn6 ^i[Satta]—“the bright principle”: Skr. ^i[sattva]; one of the three principles in the Sāṅkhya system, the other two being ^i[rajas] (Pali: ^i[rajo]) or turbulence and ^i[tamas] (Pali: ^i[tamo]) or darkness. Not in PED.
^fn7 “Here when the aggregates are not fully understood, there is naming (^i[abhidhāna]) of them and of the consciousness of them as self (^i[attā]), that is to say, the physical body or alternatively the five aggregates. ‘Derived from’: apprehending, gripping, making a support. ‘Since it is actually a mere concept’: because of presence (^i[sabbhāvato]) as a mere concept in what is called a being, though in the highest sense the ‘being’ is non- existent” (Vism-mhṭ 298). See also Ch. VIII, note 11.
^fn8 Harvard text reads ^i[byāpādarahita], which would be renderable as “free from ill will.” Vism-mhṭ (p. 299) supports a reading ^i[byābādha], which seems better.
^fn9 For ^i[duṭṭhulla] see Ch. IV, note 36. Here the meaning is more likely to be “bad” or “lewd” than “inert.”
^fn10 ^i[Muditā]—“gladness” as one of the divine abidings is always in the sense of gladness at others’ success. Sometimes rendered as “altruistic joy” and “sympathetic gladness.”
^fn11 ^i[Kiṇāti]—“it combats”: Skr. ^i[kṛnāti]—to injure or kill. PED gives this ref. under ordinary meaning “to buy,” which is wrong.
^fn12 So Vism-mhṭ 309.
^fn13 All texts read ^i[kassa] (whose), which is confirmed in the quotation translated in note 20. It is tempting, in view of the context, to read ^i[kammassa] (kamma’s), but there is no authority for it. The statement would then be an assertion instead of a question.
^fn14 “Greed is the near enemy of loving-kindness since it is able to corrupt owing to its similarity, like an enemy masquerading as a friend” (Vism-mhṭ 309).
^fn15 ^i[Paṭihaññati]—“to be resentful”: not in PED; the verb has been needed to correspond to “resentment” (^i[paṭigha]), as the verb, “to be inflamed with greed” (^i[rajjati]) corresponds with “greed” (^i[rāga]).
^fn16 ^i[Sambhāvetvā]—“judging”: not in this sense in PED. Vism-mhṭ (p. 313) explains by ^i[parikappetvā](conjecturing).
^fn17 For which kinds of body contemplation give which kinds of concentration see 8.43 and M-a I 247.
^fn18 ^i[“‘Mere unification of the mind’]: the kind of concentrating (^i[samādhāna]) that is undeveloped and just obtained by one in pursuit of development. That is called ‘basic concentration,’ however, since it is the basic reason for the kinds of more distinguished concentration to be mentioned later in this connection. This ‘mere unification of the mind’ is intended as momentary concentration as in the passage beginning, ‘I internally settled, steadied, unified and concentrated my mind’ (M I 116). For the first unification of the mind is recognized as momentary concentration here as it is in the first of the two successive descriptions: ‘Tireless energy was aroused in me … my mind was concentrated and unified’ followed by ‘Quite secluded from sense desires …’” (M I 21) (Vism-mhṭ 314).
^fn19 “‘^i[Thus developed]’: just as a fire started with wood and banked up with cowdung, dust, etc., although it arrives at the state of a ‘cowdung fire,’ etc., (cf. M I 259) is nevertheless called after the original fire that was started with the wood, so too it is the basic concentration that is spoken of here, taking it as banked up with loving- kindness, and so on. ‘In other objects’ means in such objects as the earth kasiṇa” (Vism-mhṭ 315).
^fn20 “The beautiful” (^i[subha]) is the third of the eight liberations (^i[vimokkha]—see M II 12; M-a III 255).
^fn21 Reading in both cases “^i[avijjamāna-gahaṇa-dakkhaí cittaí],” not “-^i[dukkhaí].” “‘^i[Because it has no more concern (ābhoga])’: because it has no further act of being concerned (^i[ābhujana]) by hoping (^i[āsiísanā]) for their pleasure, etc., thus ‘May they be happy.’ The development of loving-kindness, etc., occurring as it does in the form of hope for beings’ pleasure, etc., makes them its object by directing [the mind] to apprehension of [what is existent in] the ultimate sense [i.e. pleasure, etc.]. But development of equanimity, instead of occurring like that, makes beings its object by simply looking on. But does not the divine abiding of equanimity itself too make beings its object by directing the mind to apprehension of [what is existent in] the ultimate sense, because of the words, ‘Beings are owners of their deeds. Whose [if not theirs] is the choice by which they will become happy …?’ (§96)—Certainly that is so. But that is in the prior stage of development of equanimity. When it has reached its culmination, it makes beings its object by simply looking on. So its occurrence is specially occupied with what is non-existent in the ultimate sense [i.e. beings, which are a concept]. And so skill in apprehending the non-existent should be understood as avoidance of bewilderment due to misrepresentation in apprehension of beings, which avoidance of bewilderment has reached absorption” (Vism-mhṭ).

^fn1 “A dog, it seems, was attacked in the forest by a boar and fled. When it was dusk he saw in the distance a cauldron for boiling rice, and perceiving it as a boar, he fled in fear and terror. Again, a man who was afraid of ^i[pisāca] goblins saw a decapitated palm stump at night in a place that was unfamiliar to him, and perceiving it as a ^i[pisāca] goblin, he fell down in his fear, horror and confusion” (Vism-mhṭ 320).
^fn2 PED, this ref. reads ^i[yānapuṭosā] for ^i[yānapatoḷi], taking it as one compound (see under ^i[yāna] and ^i[mutoḷī], but this does not fit the context happily. Vism-mhṭ (p. 321) has: “‘^i[Yānappatoḷikumbhimukhādīnan]’
^i[ti oguṇṭhana-sivikādi-yānaí mukhaí = yāna-mukhaí; patoḷiyā kuddakadvārassa mukhaí = patoḷi-mukhaí; kumbhi-mukhan ti paccekaí mukha- saddo sambandhitabbo].” This necessitates taking ^i[yāna] separately.
^fn3 These two quotations refer respectively to the first of the eight liberations and the first of the eight bases of mastery (See M-a III 255ff.).
^fn4 This explanation depends on a play on the word ^i[saññā] as the [subjective] perception and as the [objective] sign, signal or label perceived.
^fn5 See XIV.129, description of perception aggregate, which is classified in the same way as the consciousness aggregate. Those referred to here are the fifteen fine- material kinds, corresponding to nos. (9–l3), (57–61) and (81–85) in Table III.
^fn6 See XIV.96f. nos. (34–38) and (50–54) in Table III.
^fn7 “A [formed] dhamma with an individual essence is delimited by rise and fall because it is produced after having not been, and because after having been it vanishes. But space is called boundless since it has neither rise nor fall because it is a dhamma without individual essence” (Vism-mhṭ 323).
^fn8 “He should not give attention to it only as ‘Boundless, boundless;’ instead of developing it thus, he should give attention to it as ‘Boundless consciousness, boundless consciousness’ or as ‘Consciousness, consciousness’” (Vism-mhṭ 324).
^fn9 There is a play on the words ^i[natthi kiñci] (“there is nothing”) and ^i[akiñcana] (“non- owning”). At M I 298 there occurs the expression “^i[Rāgo kho āvuso kiñcano] (greed, friend, is an owning),” which is used in connection with this attainment. The commentary (M-a II 354) says “^i[Rāgo uppajjitvā puggalaí kiñcati, maddati, palibujjhati, tasmā kiñcano ti vutto] (greed having arisen owns, presses, impedes, a person, that is why it is called an owning)” (Cf. M-a I 27; also XXI.53 and note 19). Vism-mhṭ (p. 327) here says “^i[Kiñcanan ti kiñci pi].”The word ^i[kiñcati] is not in PED.
^fn10 ^i[Mahacca] (see D I 49 and D-a I 148); the form is not given in PED; probably a form of ^i[mahatiya].
^fn11 ^i[Sukhodaka]—“tepid water”: see Monier Williams’ ^i[Sanskrit Dictionary]; this meaning of ^i[sukha] not given in PED.

^fn1 “The word ‘perception’ (^i[saññā]) is used for the ^i[dhamma] with the characteristic of perceiving (^i[sañjānana]), as in the case of ‘perception of visible objects,’ ‘perception of sound,’ etc.; and it is used for insight, as in the case of ‘perception of impermanence,’ ‘perception of suffering,’ etc.; and it is used for serenity, as in the passage, ‘Perception of the bloated and perception of visible objects, have these one meaning or different meanings, Sopāka?’ (^i[Source untraced.] Cf. III.111), and so on. Here, however, it should be understood as the preliminary work for serenity; for it is the apprehending of the repulsive aspect in nutriment, or the access jhāna produced by means of that, that is intended here by, ‘perception of repulsiveness in nutriment’”(Vism-mhṭ 334–35).
^fn2 A more detailed exposition of nutriment is given at M-a I 107ff. “‘It nourishes’ (^i[āharati])”: the meaning is that it leads up, fetches, produces, its own fruit through its state as a condition for the fruit’s arising or presence, which state is called “nutriment condition.” It is made into a mouthful (^i[kabalaí karīyati]), thus it is physical (^i[kabaliṅkāra]). In this way it gets its designation from the concrete object; but as to characteristic, it should be understood to have the characteristic of nutritive essence (^i[ojā]). It is physical and it is nutriment in the sense stated, thus it is physical nutriment; so with the rest. It touches (^i[phusati]), thus it is contact (^i[phassa]); for although this is an immaterial state, it occurs also as the aspect of touching on an object (^i[ārammaṇa]—lit. “what is to be leaned on”), which is why it is said to have the characteristic of touching. It wills (^i[cetayati]), thus it is volition (^i[cetanā]); the meaning is that it arranges (collects) itself together with associated states upon the object. Mental volition is volition occupied with the mind. It cognizes (^i[vijānāti]) by conjecturing about rebirth (see XVII.303), thus it is consciousness (^i[viññāṇa] = cognition) (Vism-mhṭ 335).
^fn3 For the “octad with nutritive essence as eighth” (^i[ojaṭṭhamaka),] see XVIII.5ff. and XX.27ff.
^fn4 Vism-mhṭ (p. 355) explains ^i[attachment] here as craving which is “perilous because it brings harm” (see e.g. D II 58–59), or in other words, “greed for the five aggregates (lust after five-aggregate experience).” It cites the following: “Bhikkhus, when there is physical nutriment, there is greed (lust), there is delighting, there is craving; consciousness being planted therein grows. Wherever consciousness being planted grows, there is the combination of mind-and-matter. Wherever there is the combination of mind-and-matter, there is ramification of formations. Wherever there is ramification of formations, there is production of further becoming in the future. Wherever there is production of further becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging and death. Wherever there is future birth, aging and death, bhikkhus, the end is sorrow, I say, with woe and despair” (S II 101; cf. S II 66). ^i[Approaching] is explained as “meeting, coinciding, with unabandoned perversions [of perception] due to an object [being perceived as permanent, etc., when it is not].” That is, “perilous since it is not free from the three kinds of suffering.” The quotation given is: “Bhikkhus, due to contact of the kind to be felt as pleasant, pleasant feeling arises. With that feeling as condition there is craving, … thus there is the arising of this whole mass of suffering” (cf. S IV 215). ^i[Reappearance] is “rebirth in some kind of becoming or other. Being flung into a new becoming is perilous because there is no immunity from the risks rooted in reappearance.” The following is quoted: “Not knowing, bhikkhus, a man forms the formation of merit, and his [rebirth] consciousness accords with the merit [tie performed]; he forms the formation of demerit; … he forms the formation of the imperturbable …” (S II 82). ^i[Rebirth-linking] is the actual linking with the next becoming, which “is perilous since it is not immune from the suffering due to the signs of [the impending] rebirth-linking.” The quotation given is: “Bhikkhus, when there is consciousness as nutriment there is greed (lust), there is delighting …” (S II 102— complete as above).
^fn5 “‘^i[Twenty or thirty times’]: here some say that the definition of the number of times is according to what is present-by-continuity (see XIV.188). But others say that it is by way of “warming up the seat” (see M-a I 255); for development that has not reached suppression of hindrances does not remove the bodily discomfort in the act of sitting, because of the lack of pervading happiness. So there is inconstancy of posture too. Then ‘twenty or thirty’ is taken as the number already observed by the time of setting out on the alms round. Or alternatively, from ‘going’ up to ‘smearing’ is one turn; then it is after giving attention to the meditation subject by twenty or thirty turns in this way” (Vism-mhṭ 339).
^fn6 ^i[Paccattharaṇa—“]carpet”: the word normally means a coverlet, but here, according to Vism-mhṭ, (p. 339) it is, “a spread ^i[(attharaṇa)] consisting of a rug ^i[(cilimika)] to be spread on the ground for protecting the skin.”
^fn7 For ^i[pamukha—“]doorstep^i[,”] perhaps an open upper floor gallery here, see XIII.6.
^fn8 ^i[Jatukā—“]bat^i[”] = ^i[khuddaka-vaggulī] (Vism-mhṭ 339): not in PED; see XIII.97.
^fn9 ^i[Pārāvata—“]pigeon^i[”]: only spelling ^i[pārāpata] given in PED.
^fn10 For this meaning of ^i[pariveṇa] see Ch. IV, note 37.
^fn11 ^i[Vitakka-māḷaka—“]debating lodge”: Vism-mhṭ (p. 339) says: “‘^i[Kattha nu kho ajja bhikkhāya caritabban’ ti ādinā vitakkamāḷake”] (“in a lodge for thinking in the way beginning ‘Where must I go for alms today?’”).
^fn12 ^i[Piṇḍika-maísa—“]flesh of the calves” ^i[= jaṅghapiṇḍikaíamsapadesa.] (Vism-mhṭ 340) Cf. VIII.97; also A-a 417. Not in this sense in PED.
^fn13 ^i[Kummāsa—“]jelly^i[”]: usually rendered “junket,” but the Vinaya commentaries give it as made of corn ^i[(yava)].
^fn14 ^i[Nāgabalā]—a kind of plant; not in PED.
^fn15 ^i[Pavana]—“draught”: not in this sense in PED; see XVI.37.
^fn16 ^i[Dhātu—“]ore^i[”]: not in this sense in PED. See also XV.20.
^fn17 “‘^i[A certain one’] is said with reference to the anal orifice. But those who are scrupulously clean by nature wash their hands again after washing the mouth, and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 342).
^fn18 “‘^i[That sign]’: that object as the sign for development, which sign is called ^i[physical nutriment] and has appeared in the repulsive aspect to one who gives his attention to it repeatedly in the ways already described. And there, while development occurs through the repulsive aspect, it is only the dhammas on account of which there comes to be the concept of physical nutriment that are repulsive, not the concept. But it is because the occurrence of development is contingent only upon dhammas with an individual essence, and because the profundity is due to that actual individual essence of dhammas that have individual essences, that the jhāna cannot reach absorption in it through apprehension of the repulsive aspect. For it is owing to profundity that the first pair of truths is hard to see” (Vism-mhṭ 342–43).
^fn19 “‘^i[By characterizing individual essences]’: by making certain ^i[(upadhāraṇa)] of the specific characteristics of hardness, and so on. For this meditation subject does not consist in the observing of a mere concept, as in the case of the earth kasiṇa as a meditation subject, neither does it consist in the observing of the colour blue, etc., as in the case of the blue kasiṇa as a meditation subject, nor in the observing of the general characteristics of impermanence, etc., in formations, as in the case of insight as a meditation subject; but rather it consists in the observing of the individual essences of earth, and so on. That is why ‘by characterizing individual essences’ is said, which means, ‘by making certain of the specific characteristics of hardness, and so on”(Vism- mhṭ 344).
^fn20 “Herein, as regards ^i[‘earth element,’] etc., the meaning of element is the meaning of individual essence, the meaning of individual essence is the meaning of voidness, the meaning of voidness is the meaning of not-a-living-being. So it is just earth in the sense of individual essence, voidness and not-a-living-being that is the element; hence it is earth element; so too in the case of the water element, and the rest. The earth element is the element that is the foothold for the conascent material states. Likewise the water element is the element of their cohesion; the fire element is the element of their ripening; and the air element is the element of their conveyance and distension” (Vism-mhṭ 345). To avoid confusion, it might be mentioned here that in “physical” earth, fire, water, and air, it would be held that all four elements are present in each equally, but that in “physical” earth the earth element is dominant in efficacy as the mode of hardness; and correspondingly with water and the rest. See e.g. XIV.45.
^fn21 ^i[Kharigata]—“harsh”: not in PED, but see ^i[khara].
^fn22 “What occurs in attendance ^i[(adhikicca)] upon self ^i[(attā)] by its pertaining to the state that may be taken as self because it is included in one’s own continuity as internal
^i[(ajjhatta)”] (Vism-mhṭ 347).
^fn23 ^i[Jara—“fever”]: not in PED; see A V 100; Nidd I 17.
^fn24 ^i[Vitthambhana]—“distension”: the word most usually employed to describe the air element. It is often rendered by “supporting,” a word earmarked here for ^i[nissaya.] The twofold function of the air element is (a) to uphold ^i[(sandhārana)] by distending ^i[(vitthambhana)] and preventing collapse (§92), and (b) to move ^i[(samudīraṇa),] or more strictly, cause the appearance of motion ^i[(calana,] see n. 37). In XIV.61 it is said to cause ^i[thambhana,] rendered by “stiffening”; but there is the description of the earth element as ^i[thaddha] (e.g. §39; pp. of ^i[thambhati,] from which the noun ^i[thambhana] comes), rendered by “stiffenedness.” It may also be noted that the word ^i[sandhāraṇa] (upholding) is used to describe both the earth element (XIV.47) and the air element (XIV.61).
^fn25 ^i[Drava-bhāva]—“fluidity”: not in PED.

^fn29 ^i[“‘Because of bearing their own characteristics’] : these are not like the Primordial Essence ^i[(pakati—Skr. prakṛti)] and the self ^i[(attā)] imagined by the theorists which are non-existent as to individual essence. On the contrary, these do bear their own characteristics, which is why they are elements” (Vism-mhṭ 359). Capitals have been used here and elsewhere though Indian alphabets do not justify it. ^i[Appāyati—“]to satisfy” is not in PED; see Vibh-a 9.
^fn30 ^i[“‘From resolution of these eight’]: the eight dhammas beginning with colour when resolved by means of understanding, are apprehendable ^i[(upalabbhanti)] in the ultimate sense through mutual negation ^i[(aññam-añña-vyatirekena);] but head hairs are not apprehendable in the ultimate sense through negation of colour and so on. Consequently, the term of common usage ‘head hairs’ is applied to these dhammas in their co-arisen state; but if they are each taken separately, ^i[‘There is no common-usage head hairs.’] The meaning is that it is a mere conventional term. ^i[‘Only a mere group of eight states’] is said, taking the colour, etc., which are real ^i[(bhūta—lit.] ‘become’), as a unity by means of the concept ^i[(paññatti)] ‘a head hair,’ not only because they are merely the eight states” (Vism-mhṭ 360).
^fn31 ^i[Paramaṇu]—“the smallest atom”; see Vibh-a 343. According to Vibh-a, the size of a ^i[paramaṇu] works out at 1/581,147,136th part of an ^i[aṅgula] (fingerbreadth or inch). Vism-mhṭ remarks (p. 361): “Therefore … a ^i[paramaṇu] as a particle of space is not the province of the physical eye, it is the province of the divine eye.”
^fn32 ^i[Saṅgahita]—“held together”: not quite in this sense in PED. “Held ^i[(gahita)] by conjoining through cohesion and prevented from being scattered” (Vism-mhṭ 361).
^fn33 “Kept guarded ^i[(anurakkhita)] so that it may not lapse into a wet and slippery state through the water element, which has trickling as its essence” (Vism-mhṭ 361).

^fn35 “This is said with reference to the water element as a juice that helps growth” (Vism-mhṭ 361).
^fn36 ^i[Samabbhāhata]—“propelled”: see Ch. IV, note 38.
^fn37 ^i[Abhinīhāra]—“conveying”: not in this sense in PED. “^i[‘Conveying’] is acting as cause for the successive arising at adjacent locations ^i[(desantaruppatti)] of the conglomeration of elements ^i[(bhūta-saṅghāta)”] (Vism-mhṭ 363). Elsewhere Vism-mhṭ (p. 359) says of the air element: “‘^i[It blows’] (§87): it is stirred; the meaning is that the conglomeration of elements is made to move (go) by its action as cause for successive arising at adjacent locations (points),” and “Propelling ^i[(samabbhāhana)] is the act of causing the successive arising at adjacent locations of material groups ^i[(rūpa-kalāpa)]” (p. 362).
^fn38 “A great primary ^i[(mahābhūta)] is a great wonder ^i[(mahanto abbhuto)] because it shows various unreal things ^i[(abhūta),] various wonders ^i[(abbhuta),] and various marvels ^i[(acchariya).] Or alternatively: there are great wonders ^i[(abbhuta)] here, thus there are magicians. And spirits, etc., are huge ^i[(mahant)] creatures ^i[(bhūta)] owing to being born from them, thus they are great primaries. Or alternatively: this term ‘great primary’ can be regarded as a generic term for all of them. But earth, etc., are great primaries because they deceive, and because, like the huge creatures, their standing place cannot be pointed to. The deception lies in causing the apparent individual essences of blue-black, etc., and it lies in causing the appearance of what has the aspect of woman and man, and so on. Likewise their undemonstrability, since they are not found inside or outside each other though they rely upon each other for support. For if these elements were found inside each other, they would not each perform their particular functions, owing to mutual frustration. And if they were found outside each other, they would be already resolved (separate), and that being so, any description of them as unresolved (inseparable) would be meaningless. So although their standing place is undemonstrable, still each one assists the other by its particular function—the functions of establishing, etc., whereby each becomes a condition for the others as conascence condition and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 363).
^fn39 This alludes to the length of duration of a moment of matter’s existence, which is described as seventeen times as long as that of consciousness (see Vibh-a 25f.).
^fn40 “The term ^i[‘producing condition’] refers to causing origination, though as a condition it is actually kamma condition. For this is said: ‘Profitable and unprofitable volition is a condition, as kamma condition, for resultant aggregates and for materiality due to kamma performed’ (Paṭṭh I 5)” (Vism-mhṭ 368).
^fn41 “‘^i[For the rest’]: for consciousness-originated, and so on. It is the indirectly decisive- support condition because in the Paṭṭhāna the decisive-support condition has only been given for immaterial dhammas, so there is, directly, no decisive-support condition [in kamma] for material dhammas. However, because of the words, ‘With a person as decisive support’ (M I 107) and ‘With a grove as decisive support’ (M I 106) in the Suttas, the decisive-support condition can be indirectly understood according to the
^fn42 ^i[Ugghāta]—“exhilarated” and ^i[nigghāta]—“depressed”: neither word is in PED; Vism-mhṭ glosses with ^i[ubbilāvitatta] and ^i[dīnabhāvappatti] respectively.
^fn43 Reading ^i[yogivarasīhassa kīlitaí.] Cf. ^i[Nettippakaraṇa] “Sīha-kīlana.”
^fn44 The sense demands reading with Vism-mhṭ ^i[appanāpubba-bhāgacittesu] as a single compound.
^fn45 This is an allusion to M I 179, etc. “The process of existence in the round of rebirths, which is a very cramped place, is crowded by the defilements of craving and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 371).
^fn46 ^i[Sūdana]—“cleaning”: not in PED. See title of Majjhima Nikāya Commentary. Another reading here is ^i[sodhana].

^fn1 Āneñja—“imperturbability”: a term normally used for the four immaterial states, together with the fourth jhāna. See also §16f., and MN 106.
^fn2 ^i[Giribhaṇḍavahanapūjā]: Vism-mhṭ (p. 375) says: “^i[Giribhaṇḍa-vahanapūjā nāma Cetiyagirií ādií katvā sakaladīpe samudde ca yāva yojanā mahatī dīpapūjā] (‘it is a name for a great island-offering starting with the Cetiyagiri (Mihintale) and extending over the whole island and up to a league into the sea ’).” Mentioned in A-a to AN 1:1; M-a II 398; and ^i[Mahāvaísa] XXXIV.81.
^fn3 These are the four headings of the roads to power (see §50).
^fn4 I.e. one wants it to be known that he can practice jhāna.
^fn5 “It counter-strikes (^i[paṭiharati)], thus it is a counter-stroke (^i[pāṭihāriya]—metamorphosis= miracle). What strikes out (^i[harati)], removes, what is counter to it (^i[paṭipakkha)] is therefore called counter-striking (^i[paṭihāriya)], since what is counter-striking strikes out anything counter (^i[paṭipakkha)] to itself. ^i[Paṭihāriya] (counter-striking) is the same as ^i[pāṭihāriya] (counter-stroke = metamorphosis = miracle)” (Vism-mhṭ 379).
^fn6 ^i[Sītā:] not in this sense in PED. Vism-mhṭ (p. 383) says, “It is the path traversed by a ploughshare in ploughing that is called a ^i[sītā].” Another reading is ^i[karīsa] (an area of land).
^fn7 ^i[Visavitā]—“majesty”: not in PED; cf. ^i[passavati.] Vism-mhṭ (p. 385) glosses with ^i[iddhiyā ividhānisaísa-pasavanāya.] Cf. Dhs-a 109; Dhs-ṭ (p. 84) glosses thus ^i[visavitāyā ti arahatāya].

^fn9 ^i[Aneja] (or ^i[aneñja])—“unperturbed”: form not in PED.
^fn10 ^i[Aṅgīrasa]—“the One with Radiant Limbs”: one of the epithets for the Buddha. Not in PED; see A III 239.
^fn11 Dedication of what is to be given accompanied by pouring water over the hand.
^fn12 “‘^i[They become of the kinds desired]’: they become whatever the kinds that were desired: for they come to possess as many varieties in appearance, etc., as it was wished they should have. But although they become manifold in this way by being made the object in different modes of appearance, nevertheless it is only a single resolution consciousness that occurs. This is its power. For it is like the single volition that produces a personality possessed of many different facets (see Ch. XIV, n. 14). And there it is the aspiration to become that is a condition for the differentiation in the kamma; and kamma-result is imponderable. And here too it is the preliminary-work consciousness that should be taken as a condition for the difference. And the field of supernormal power is imponderable too.” (Vism-mhṭ 390)
^fn13 Certain grammatical problems arise about the case of the words ^i[āvibhāvaí], etc., both in the sutta passage and (more so) in the Paṭisambhidā passage; they are examined by Vism-mhṭ (p. 390) but are not renderable into English.
^fn14 ^i[Kūṭāgāra]—“palanquin”: not in this sense in PED. See story at M-a V 90, where it is told how 500 of these were made by Sakka’s architect Vissakamma for the Buddha to journey through the air in. The same word is also commonly used in the Commentaries for the portable structure (catafalque) in which a bier is carried to the pyre. This, built often in the form of a house, is still used now in Sri Lanka and called ^i[ransivi-ge]. See A-a commentary to AN 3:42, and to AN 1:38; also Dhp-a III 470. Not in this sense in PED.
^fn15 The only book in the Tipiṭaka to mention the Twin Miracle is the Paṭisambhidāmagga (Paṭis I 53).16 Anāthapiṇḍika’s younger brother (Vism-mhṭ 391).
^fn16 Anāthapiṇḍika’s younger brother (Vism-mhṭ 391).
^fn17 ^i[Okāseti]—“to scatter”: PED, this ref., gives “to show,” which does not fit the context. Vism-mhṭ glosses with ^i[pakirati].
^fn18 Vism-mhṭ (p.394): “^i[Vadhūkumārikaññā-vatthāhi tividhāhi nāṭakitthīhi].”
^fn19 “‘^i[The ramparts of Sineru]’: the girdle of Sineru. There are, it seems, four ramparts that encircle Sineru, measuring 5,000 leagues in breadth and width. They were built to protect the realm of the Thirty-three against nāgas, garudas, kumbhaṇḍas and yakkhas. They enclose half of Sineru, it seems” (Vism-mhṭ 394).
^fn20 “Only this is correct because instances of clung-to (kammically acquired) materiality do not arise owing to consciousness or to temperature. Or alternatively, ‘clung-to’ is intended as all matter that is bound up with faculties (i.e. ‘sentient’), too. And so to take it as enlargement of that is likewise not correct. Consequently, enlargement should be understood only in the way stated. Though the clung-to and the unclung-to occur, as it were, mixed up in a single continuity, they are nevertheless not mixed up in meaning. Herein, just as when a pint measure (^i[āḷhaka]) of milk is poured into a number of pints of water, though the milk becomes completely mixed up with the water, and is present appreciably in all, it is nevertheless not the milk that has increased there, but only the water. And so too, although the clung-to and unclung-to occur mixed up together, it is nevertheless not the clung-to that is enlarged. It should be taken that it is the consciousness-born matter that is enlarged by the influence of the supernormal power, and the temperature-born is enlarged ^i[pari passu]” (Vism-mhṭ 395).
^fn21 “‘^i[There is only the going of consciousness]’: there is only a going that is the same as that of the mind. But how does the body, whose going [being that of matter] is slow, come to have the same going as the mind, which quickly passes? Its going is not the same in all respects; for in the case of converting the mind to conform with the body, the mind does not come to have the same going as the body in all respects. For it is not that the mind then occurs with the moment of a material state, which passes slowly, instead of passing with its own kind of moment, which is what establishes its individual essence. But rather the mind is called ‘converted to accord with the going of the body’ as long as it goes on occurring in a continuity that conforms with the body until the desired place is arrived at. This is because its passing occurs parallel with that of the body, whose going is slow, owing to the resolution, ‘Let the mind be like this body.’ And likewise, it is while the body keeps occurring in suchwise that its arrival at the desired place comes about in only a few quick passes of the mind instead of passing slowly, as in those who have not developed the roads to power—and this mode of occurrence is due to the possession of the perception of lightness, to say nothing of the resolve, ‘Let this body be like this mind’—that the body is called ‘converted to accord with the going of the mind,’ not because it arrives at the desired place in a single consciousness moment. And when taken thus the simile, ‘Just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm, or bend his outstretched arm’ (Vin I 5) can be taken literally. And this must be accepted in this way without reserve, otherwise there is conflict with the Suttas, the Abhidhamma and the Commentary, as well as contradiction of natural law (^i[dhammatā]). ‘Bhikkhus, I see no other one thing that is so quickly transformed as the mind’ (A I 10)—here it is material states that are referred to by the word ‘other’ because they do not pass quickly. And in the Abhidhamma only matter is called prenascence condition and only consciousness postnascence condition. And wherever states (^i[dhamma]) arise, there they dissolve. There is no transmigration to an adjacent location (^i[desantara-saṅkamana]), nor does the individual essence become other. For it is not possible to effect any alteration of the characteristics of dhammas by force of the roads to power. But it is possible to effect alteration of the mode in which they are present (^i[bhāva])” (Vism-mhṭ 397).
^fn22 “This should be regarded as implying that there is no sex or life faculty in it either.” (Vism-mhṭ 398).
^c13
^fn1 “With the consciousness belonging to the particular concentration that constitutes the preliminary work. The meaning is: by means of consciousness concentrated with the momentary concentration that occurs in the form of the preliminary work for knowledge of the divine ear element. The occasion of access for the divine ear element is called preliminary-work consciousness, but that as stated refers to multiple advertings” (Vism-mhṭ 401).
^fn2 “The sound sign is the sound itself since it is the cause for the arising of the knowledge. Or the gross-subtle aspect acquired in the way stated is the sound sign” (Vism-mhṭ 402).
^fn3 “This is momentary-concentration consciousness, which owing to the fact that the preliminary work contingent upon the sound has been performed, occurs in one who has attained the basic jhāna and emerged for the purpose of arousing the divine ear element” (Vism-mhṭ 402).
^fn4 “‘^i[Becomes merged]’ is amalgamated with the divine ear element. He is called an obtainer of divine-ear knowledge as soon as the absorption consciousness has arisen. The meaning is that there is now no further need of development for the purpose” (Vism-mhṭ 403).
^fn5 The “matter of the heart” is not the heart-basis, but rather it is the heart as the piece of flesh described as resembling a lotus bud in shape outside and like a ^i[kosātakī] fruit inside (VIII.111). For the blood mentioned here is to be found with that as its support. But the heart-basis occurs with this blood as its support” (Vism-mhṭ 403).
^fn6 “Of one who has not done any interpreting (^i[abhinivesa]) reckoned as study for direct-knowledge” (Vism-mhṭ 407). A rather special use of the word ^i[abhinivesa], perhaps more freely renderable here as “practice.”
^fn7 For the term ^i[chinna-vaṭumaka] (“one who has broken the cycle of rebirths”) as an epithet of former Buddhas, see M III 118.
^fn8 ^i[Saívaṇṇita]—“given in detail”; Vism-mhṭ glosses by ^i[vitthāritan ti attho]. Not in this meaning in PED. See prologue verses to the four Nikāyas.
^fn9 A commentarial account of the behaviour of lions will be found in the ^i[Manorathapurāṇī], commentary to AN 4:33. Vism-mhṭ says:^i[Sīh-okkamana-vasena sīhātipatanavasena ñāṇagatiyā gacchati] (p. 408).
^fn10 ^i[Ugghaṭetvā]: see X.6; the word is obviously used here in the same sense.
^fn11 “The ‘ordinary sun’ is the sun’s divine palace that arose before the emergence of the aeon. But like the other sense-sphere deities at the time of the emergence of the aeon, the sun deity too produces jhāna and reappears in the Brahmā-world. But the actual sun’s disk becomes brighter and more fiery. Others say that it disappears and another appears in its place” (Vism-mhṭ 412).
^fn12 The five are the Ganges, Yamunā (Jumma), Sarabhu, Sarassatī, and Mahī (Vism-mhṭ 412).
^fn13 ^i[Haísapātana] is another name for ^i[Maṇḍākinī.] (Vism-mhṭ) For seven Great Lakes see A IV 101.
^fn14 “At the place where the Yāma Deities are established. The places where the Cātumahārājika and Tāvatiísa heavens become established do not reappear at first because they are connected with the earth” (Vism-mhṭ 412).
^fn15 ^i[Khārudaka]—“caustic waters”: the name given to the waters on which the world- spheres rest (see M-a IV 178).
^fn16 ^i[Kūṭāgāra:] see Ch. XII, n.14; here this seems the most likely of the various meanings of the word.
^fn17 ^i[“‘He cannot see them with the divine] eye’—with the knowledge of the divine eye— because of the extreme brevity and extreme subtlety of the material moment in anyone. Moreover, it is present materiality that is the object of the divine eye, and that is by prenascence condition. And there is no occurrence of exalted consciousness without adverting and preliminary work. Nor is materiality that is only arising able to serve as object condition, nor that which is dissolving. Therefore, it is rightly said that he cannot see with the divine eye materiality at the moments of death and reappearance. If the knowledge of the divine eye has only materiality as its object, then why is it said that he ‘sees beings’? It is said in this way since it is mainly concerned with instances of materiality in a being’s continuity, or because that materiality is a reason for apprehending beings. Some say that this is said according to conventional usage” (Vism-mhṭ 417).
^fn18 In rendering ^i[yathābhataí] here in this very idiomatic passage M-a II 32 has been consulted.
^fn19 For the word ^i[aya] see XVI.17.
^fn20 See ^i[Abhidhamma Mātikā] (“schedule”), Dhs 1f. This consists of 22 sets of triple classifications ^i[(tika)] and 100 sets of double ones ^i[(duka).] The first triad “profitable, unprofitable, and [morally] indeterminate,” and the first dyad is “root-cause, not- root-cause.” The ^i[Mātikā] is used in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī (for which it serves as the basic structure), in the Vibhaṅga (in some of the “Abhidhamma Sections” and in the “Questionnaires”) and in the Paṭṭhāna. All dhammas are either classifiable according to these triads and dyads, under one of the headings, if the triad or dyad is all- embracing, or are called “not-so-classifiable” ^i[(na-vattabba),] if the triad or dyad is not. The four triads mentioned here are: no. 13, “dhammas with a limited object, with an exalted object, with a measureless object”; no. 16, “dhammas with a path as object, with a path as root-cause, with path as predominance”; no. 19, “dhammas with a past object, with a future object, with a present object”; and no. 21, “dhammas with an internal object, with an external object, with an internal-external object.”
^fn21 The “word in the accusative case” is in the first instance “body,” governed by the verb “converts”
^i[(kāyaí pariṇāmeti);] see Vism-mhṭ.
^fn22 Vism-mhṭ comments: “Although with the words: ^i[‘These perfumes,’] etc., he apprehends presentperfumes,etc.,neverthelessthe object of his resolving consciousness is actually their future materiality that is to be associated with the distinction of not drying up^i[.] This is because the resolve concerns the future … ^i[‘Cream of curd’:] when resolving, his object is the future appearance of curd.”
Vattanīyasenāsana was apparently a monastery in the Vindhya Hills (^i[Viñjaṭavī]): see Mhv XIX.6; Dhs-a 419. The Elders Assagutta and Rohaṇa instructed Kajaṅgala who was sent to convert Menander (Lamotte, ^i[Histoire de la Bouddhisme Indien,] p. 440).
^fn23 Cf. also Vibh 62 and 91.
^fn24 Vism-mhṭ adds: “Some however explain the meaning in this way: It is as long as, when one has stepped on the dry bank with a wet foot, the water line on the foot does not disappear.”

^fn1 Cf. Paṭis I 42, etc.; Abhidhamma definitions very commonly make use of the Pali forms of verbal nouns, here instanced by ^i[paññā] (understanding = state of under- standing) and ^i[pajānana] (understanding = act of understanding), both from the verb ^i[pajānāti] (he understands). English does not always, as in this case, distinguish between the two. Similarly, for example, from the verb ^i[socati] (he sorrows) we find ^i[soka] (sorrow, state of sorrowing) and ^i[socana] (sorrowing, act of sorrowing), and here the English differentiates. Cf. parallel treatment of ^i[paññā] at M-a II 343f.
^fn2 “In arisings of consciousness with two root-causes [i.e. with non-greed and non- hate but without non-delusion], or without root-cause, understanding does not occur” (Vism-mhṭ 432). “Just as pleasure is not invariably inseparable from happiness, so perception and consciousness are not invariably inseparable from understanding. But just as happiness is invariably inseparable from pleasure, so understanding is invariably inseparable from perception and consciousness” (Vism-mhṭ 432).
^fn3 “A phenomenon’s own essence (^i[sako bhāvo]) or existing essence ^i[(samāno vā bhāva)] is its individual essence ^i[(sabhāva])” (Vism-mhṭ 433). Cf. Ch. VIII, note 68, where Vism- mhṭ gives the definition from ^i[saha-bhāva] (with essence).
^fn4 ^i[Paṭisambhidā] is usually rendered by “analysis” (see e.g. ^i[Points of Controversy— Kathāvatthu] translation—pp.377ff). But the Tipiṭaka explanations of the four ^i[paṭisambhidā] suggest no emphasis on ^i[analysis] rather than ^i[synthesis.] Vism-mhṭ gives the following definition of the term: “Knowledge that is classified (^i[pabheda-gata] = put into a division) under meaning ^i[(attha)] as capable of effecting the explanation and definition of specific characteristics of the meaning class (meaning division) is called ^i[attha-paṭisambhidā;] and so with the other three” (Vism-mhṭ 436). “Discrimination” has been chosen for ^i[paṭisambhidā] because, while it has the sense of “division,” it does not imply an opposite process as “analysis” does. Also it may be questioned whether the four are well described as “entirely logical”: “entirely epistemological” might perhaps be both less rigid and nearer; for they seem to cover four interlocking fields, namely: meanings of statements and effects of causes (etc.), statements of meanings and causes of effects (etc.), language as restricted to etymological rules of verbal expression, and clarity (or perspicuous inspiration) in marshalling the other three.
^fn5 I.e. the four paths with the first jhāna and those with the second, third, and fourth, out of the five (Vism-mh 434).
^fn6 The word ^i[abhinivisati] with its noun ^i[abhinivesa] means literally “to dwell on,” and so “to adhere,” or “insist.” In the Tipiṭaka it always appears in a bad sense and always appears in contexts with wrong view and clinging (see e.g. M III 30–31, Nidd I 436, and also Vism-mhṭ quoted above at I. 140). However, in the Commentaries, the word appears also in a good sense as at XIV.130, XXI.73 and 83f., and at M-a I 250 (cf. ^i[saddhaí nivisati,] M II 173). In this good sense it is synonymous with ^i[right] interpretation of experience. All the bare experience of perception is interpreted by the mind either in the sense of permanence, pleasure, self, which is wrong because it is not confirmed by experience, or in the sense of impermanence, etc., which is right because it is confirmed by experience (see XIV. 130). There is no not interpreting experience, and it is a function of the mind that the interpretation adopted is “dwelt upon,” i.e. insisted upon. And so it is this insistence or interpretation in accordance with reality as confirmed by experience that is the ^i[abhinivesa] of the Commentaries in the good sense. For these reasons the words ^i[interpretation, misinterpretation] and ^i[insistence] have been chosen here as renderings.
^fn7 ^i[Arīyati]—“to honour, to serve.” Not in PED. Cf. ger. ^i[araṇīya] (M-a I 21,173), also not in PED, explained by the ^i[Majjhima Nidāya ṭīkā] as “to be honoured” (^i[payirūpasitabba]).
^fn8 This quotation has been filled out from the Vibhaṅga text for clarity.
^fn9 ^i[Byabhicāra (vyabhicāra):] not in PED; normal grammarian’s term for an “exception.”
^fn10 The idea behind the term “individual-essence language” (^i[sabhāvanirutti),] that is to say, that there is a real name for each thing that is part of that thing’s individual essence, is dealt with at Dhs-a 391–92. Magadhan as “the root speech of all beings” and the “individual-essence language” is dealt with in greater detail at Vibh-a 387.
^fn11 The expression ^i[garapaccāgatikabhāva] refers to the practice of “carrying the meditation subject to and from the alms round,” which is described at M-a I 257 in detail. The same expression is also used of a certain kind of refuse-rag (see II. 17).
^fn12 “The ‘Chapter of Similes’ is the Chapter of Twin Verses in the Dhammapada (Dhp 1–20), they say. Others say that it is the Book of Pairs in the First Fifty (MN 31– 40)” (Vism-mhṭ 436).
^fn13 “Tangible data are omitted from this list because, not being derived matter, they are included in the primaries” (Vism-mhṭ 442). They are described as consisting of three of the four primaries, excluding the water (cohesion) element. “What is the materiality of the great primaries? It is the tangible-data base and the water-element” (Dhs 663). For the whole list see Dhs 596, in which (N.B.) the heart-basis does not appear. See also note 32 and Ch. XV, n. 15.
^fn14 “Here the first-mentioned characteristic of the eye is described according to the kamma that produces a selfhood, and is common to all of it, and this without touching on differentiation is the cause. The second is according to the specialized kamma generated thus, “Let my eye be thus.” This is what they say. But it can be taken that the first-mentioned characteristic is stated as sensitivity’s interest in lighting up its own objective fields, the five senses’ state of sensitivity being taken as a generality; and that the second is stated as the seeing that is due to the particular division of its own cause, the sensitivities’ cause as the state of kamma being taken as a generality or as a unity. The same method applies to the ear and so on.
“Here it may be asked, ‘Is the arising of the faculties of the eye, etc., due to kamma that is one or to kamma that is different?’ Now, the Ancients say, “In both ways.” Herein, firstly, in the case of the arising of an eye, etc., due to kamma that is different there is nothing to be explained since the cause is divided up. But when their arising is due to kamma that is one, how does there come to be differentiation among them? It is due to dividedness in the cause too. For it is craving, in the form of longing for this or that kind of becoming that, itself having specific forms owing to hankering after the sense-bases included in some kind of becoming or other, contrives, acting as decisive- support, the specific divisions in the kamma that generates such a kind of becoming. As soon as the kamma has acquired the differentiation induced by that [hankering] it generates through effort consisting in appropriate ability a multiple fruit with differentiated individual essences, as though it had itself taken on a multiple form. And the ability here need not be understood as anything other than the able state; for it is simply the effort of producing fruit that is differentiated by the differentiation due to the differentiation in its cause. And the fact of this differentiating effort on the part of kamma that is one being the cause of the multiple faculties will be dealt with below as to logic and texts (note 21). Besides, it is told how one kind of consciousness only is the cause of the generation of the sixteen kinds of resultant consciousness and so on; and in the world it is also found that a single paddy seed is the cause of the generation of the ripe, the unripe, the husked, and the unhusked fruit. But what is the use of logical thinking? For the eye, etc., are the fruit of kamma; and kamma-result is exclusively the province of a Buddha’s knowledge” (Vism-mhṭ 444).
^fn15 ^i[Āviñjana]—“picking up”: see ^i[āvijjhati] in PED.
^fn16 ^i[“‘Some’] are certain Mahāsaṅghikas; for among these Vasudhamma says this: ‘In the eye fire is in excess; in the ear, air; in the nose, earth; in the tongue, water; in the body all are equal’” (Vism-mhṭ 444).
^fn17 ^i[“‘As qualities of fire, and so on’:] [aided] by visible data as the illuminating [quality] of heat, which is called lighting up; by sound [as a quality] of air, by odour [as a quality] of earth, by flavour [as a quality] of the water called spittle—so according to the first theory [that of ‘some’]; and it can be suitably adjusted to accord with the second [that of ‘others’] because they need to be assisted by such and such qualities of primaries what is meant is that they have to be helped in apprehending visible data and so on. This theory holds that the quality is the ability of the eye, etc., to light up [respectively] visible data, etc., only when associated with the reasons that are their accessories consisting of light, etc., and aperture’s state of decisive support for ear-consciousness. Aperture is taken in due order, as are fire, etc., since it is absence of primaries. Or alternatively, when others intend that aperture is a quality of primaries, as visible data, etc., are, then the qualities of primaries are construable in their order thus: [aided] by visible data and light [as a quality] of fire, by sound [as a quality] of aperture called space, by odour [as a quality] of air, by flavour [as a quality] of water, by tangible data [as a quality] of earth” (Vism-mhṭ 445).
^fn18 The four primaries are held to be inseparable and not to exist separate from each other; cf. quotation from the “Ancients” in §45. Vism-mhṭ says: “Excess is in capability, not in quantity, otherwise their inseparability would be illogical” (Vism-mhṭ 451).
^fn19 ^i[“‘From finding visibility, etc., [respectively] in a state of excess’:] from finding them associated with these differences, namely, the bright visible datum in fire, sound audible through its individual essence in air, the odour beginning with ^i[surabhi] perfume in earth, and the sweet taste in water, thus ^i[‘visible data, etc., are the [respective] qualities of these.’] This is according to the first theory, and he has stated the conclusion ^i[(uttara)] that follows, beginning with ^i[‘we might assume’] in terms of that. The second is confuted in the same way. Or alternatively, ^i[‘Then they may say,’] etc., can be taken as said emphasizing, in order to confute it, the theory of Kaṇāda, which asserts that the eye, etc., are respectively made by fire, space, earth, water, and air, that have visible data, etc., as their respective qualities” (Vism-mhṭ 445).
^fn20 In the P.T.S. text and Sinhalese Hewavitarne text the word ^i[ekakalāpe,] “that form a single group,” occurs in this sentence but is not in the Harvard text.
^fn21 “If there is no differentiation according to primaries, what then is the reason for the differentiation of the eye, and so on? Though the kamma that is produced by the longing for a selfhood (individual personality) with five sense-bases is one only, still it should be taken as called ^i[‘not common to them all’] and ^i[‘difference of kamma’] because it is the cause of the differentiation of the eye, and so on. For it is not a condition for the ear through the same particular difference through which it is a condition for the eye, since, if it were, it would then follow that there was no distinction between the faculties. Because of the words, ‘At the moment of rebirth-linking, exalted volition is a condition, as kamma condition, for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed’ (Paṭṭh) it must be recognized that a single volition is kamma condition for all the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed that come into existence at the moment of rebirth-linking. For if the volition were different, then, when there came to be the arising of the faculties, it would follow that the materiality due to kamma performed was generated by limited and exalted kamma. And rebirth-linking that is one is not generated by a plurality of kinds of kamma. Thus it is established that the arising of the plurality of the faculties is due to a single kamma” (Vism-mhṭ 446).
^fn22 See also §134 and notes 60, 61. The amplification in this paragraph is from Vism- mhṭ, which continues: “There is another method: the eye and the ear have non-contiguous objective fields because arising of consciousness is caused while their objective fields are separated by an interval and apart ^i[(adhika).] Some say that the ear has a contiguous objective field. If it did, then sound born of consciousness would not be the object of ear-consciousness, for there is no arising externally of what is consciousness-originated. And in the texts sound as object is spoken of as being the object of ear-consciousness without making any distinction. Besides, there would be no defining the direction and position of the sound because it would then have to be apprehended in the place occupied by the possessor of the objective field, as happens in the case of an odour. Consequently it remains in the same place where it arose, if it comes into focus in the ear avenue (so the Burmese ed.). Are not the sounds of washermen [beating their washing on stones] heard later by those who stand at a distance? No; because there is a difference in the way of apprehending a sound according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one nearby and to one at a distance. For just as, because of difference in the way of apprehending the sound of words according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one at a distance and to one nearby, there comes to be [respectively] not apprehending, and apprehending of the differences in the syllables, so also, when the sound of washermen (a) becomes [an occurrence] that is evident throughout from beginning to end to one who is nearby, and (b) becomes an occurrence that is evident in compressed form in the end or in the middle to one who is at a distance, it is because there is a difference in the apprehending and definition, which occur later in the cognitive series of ear-consciousness, that there comes to be the assumption ^i[(abhimāna)] ‘Heard faintly is heard later.’ But that sound comes into the ear’s focus at the moment of its own existence and in dependence on the place where it arises (see XIII. 112; Dhs-a 313). If there is absolutely no successive becoming of sound, how does an echo arise? The sound, though it remains at a distance, is a condition for the arising of an echo and for the vibration of vessels, etc., elsewhere as a magnet ^i[(ayo-kanta)] is for the movement of iron” (Vism-mhṭ 446–47).
^fn23 ^i[Upādiṇṇa] (also ^i[upādiṇṇaka)] is pp. of ^i[upādiyati] (he clings), from which the noun ^i[upādāna] (clinging) also comes. ^i[Upādiṇṇa-(ka-)rūpa] (clung-to matter) = ^i[kammaja-rūpa] (kamma-born matter): see Dhs §653. It is vaguely renderable by “organic or sentient or living matter”; technically, it is matter of the four primaries that is “clung to” ^i[(upādiṇṇa)] or “derived” ^i[(upādāya)] by kamma. Generally taken as a purely Abhidhamma term (Dhs 1), it nevertheless occurs in the Suttas at M I 185 in the same sense.
^fn24 Ee reads ^i[añnamaññaí saṅkaro natthi.] Ae omits ^i[saṅkaro natthi.] The word ^i[saṅkara] in the sense of “confounding” or “error” is not in PED; see Vism concluding verses, PTS ed., p.711:
“Though these things, that is to say, the ‘mark … of the female,’ etc., arise each due to its own condition consisting in kamma, etc., they mostly only do so as modes in a continuity accompanied by the femininity faculty. And so ‘it is manifested as the reason for the mark,’ etc., is said making the femininity faculty their cause.
“As regards the ‘mark of the female,’ etc., too, its ‘facultiness’ is stated as predominance, in other words, as a state of cause, because the conditions for the modal matter (^i[ākāra-rūpa]) consisting of the mark of the female, etc., in a continuity accompanied by faculties do not arise otherwise, and because these kinds of materiality are a condition for apprehending the female. But because the femininity faculty does not generate even the material instances in its own group or maintain or consolidate them, and because it does not so act for the material instances of other groups, it is therefore not called in the text faculty, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, as the life faculty is for the material instances of its group, and as nutriment is for the material instances in succeeding groups. And it is because the mark, etc., are dependent on other conditions that wherever they have predominance its shape is encountered, even in dead and sculptured matter that resembles it. And so too with the masculinity faculty.
“And since these two do not occur together in a single continuity, because of the words, ‘Does the masculinity faculty arise in one in whom the femininity faculty arises?—No’ (Yamaka), etc., therefore even in a hermaphrodite there is only one of them at a given moment (see also Dhs-a 323)” (Vism-mhṭ 448).
^fn25 “Since the life faculty is itself entirely kamma-born it is established, by taking them as conascent, that the things to be protected by it are kamma-born too; this is why there is no inclusion of the term ‘kamma-born.’ It maintains as if it were its own that kamma-born matter by being the cause of its occurrence even though only lasting for a moment; that is why it has the characteristic of maintaining conascent kinds of matter. For kamma alone is not competent to be the cause of kamma-born things” presence, as nutriment, etc., are of the nutriment-born. Why? Because it is no longer existent at that moment.
“‘Because it does accomplish each of those functions’: it does so because it is a condition for distinguishing what is living. For it is the life faculty that distinguishes matter that is bound up with faculties from dead matter, and kamma-born matter and what is bound up with that from matter that is temperature originated, and so on.
“And the life faculty must be regarded as the reason not only for presence during a moment but also for non-interruption of connection; otherwise death as the termination of a life span would be illogical” (Vism-mhṭ 448).
^fn26 “‘The heart-basis … the support for the mind-element and for the mind- consciousness-element’: how is that to be known? (i) From scriptures and (ii) from logical reasoning.
“The scripture is this: ‘The materiality dependent on which the mind-element and mind-consciousness-element occur is a condition, as a support condition, for the mind-element and the mind-consciousness-element and what is associated therewith’ (Paṭṭh I.4). If that is so, why is it not mentioned in the Rūpakaṇḍa of the Dhammasaṅgaṇi? (Dhs §583ff.). Its not being mentioned there is for another reason. What is that? Non-inconsistency of the teaching. For while eye consciousness, etc., have the eye, etc., as their respective supports absolutely, mind-consciousness does not in the same way have the heart-basis as its support absolutely. And the teaching in the physical-basis dyad ^i[(vatthu-duka)] is given by way of the material support thus, ‘There is matter that is the physical basis of eye-consciousness, there is matter that is not the physical basis of eye-consciousness’ (Dhs §585) and so on; and if the dyads were stated by way of what had the heart-basis absolutely as its support thus, ‘There is matter that is the physical basis of mind-consciousness’ and so on, then the object dyads ^i[(ārammaṇa-duka)] do not fall into line: for one cannot say: ‘There is matter that is the object of mind-consciousness, there is matter that is not the object of mind- consciousness.’ So the physical-basis dyads and object dyads being thus made inconsistent, the teaching would lack unity, and the Master’s wish was to give the teaching here in a form that has unity. That is why the heart-basis is not mentioned, not because it is unapprehendable.
“(ii) But the logical reasoning should be understood in this way. In the five constituent becoming, [that is, in the sense sphere and fine-material sphere,] these two elements have as their support produced ^i[(nipphanna)] derived matter. Herein, since the visible- data base, etc., and nutritive essence, are found to occur apart from what is bound up with faculties, to make them the support would be illogical. And since these two elements are found in a continuity that is devoid of the femininity and masculinity faculties [i.e. in the Brahmā-world], to make them the support would be illogical too. And in the case of the life faculty that would have to have another function, so to make it the support would be illogical too. So it is the heart-basis that remains to be recognized as their support. For it is possible to say that these two elements have as their support produced derived matter, since existence is bound up with matter in the five-constituent becoming. Whatever has its existence bound up with matter is found to have as its support produced derived matter, as the eye-consciousness-element does. And the distinction ‘in the five-constituent becoming’ is made on account of the mind- consciousness-element; in the four-constituent becoming, [that is, the immaterial sphere,] there is no mind-element. Does there not follow contradiction of the middle term (hetu) because of establishing faculties as their support? No; because that is disproved by what is seen. For these two elements are not, as in the case of eye-consciousness, controlled by the slackness and keenness, etc., of their physical basis; and accordingly it is not said in the texts that they have the faculties as their condition. Hence their having faculties as their support, in other words, their being controlled by them, is disproved.
“Granted that these two elements have as their support the derived matter consisting of the heart-basis, how is it to be known that it is kamma-originated, has an invariable function, and is to be found located in the heart? It may be said to be kamma-originated because, like the eye, it is the materiality of a physical basis; and because of that it has an invariable function; because it is the materiality of a physical basis and because it is a support for consciousness, is the meaning. It is known that its location is there because of the heart’s exhaustion ^i[(khijjana)] in one who thinks of anything, bringing it to mind intently and directing his whole mind to it” (Vism-mhṭ 449–50).
The word ^i[hadaya] (heart), used in a purely mental and not physical sense, occurs in the definitions of the mind-element and mind-consciousness-element in the Vibhaṅga (Vibh 88–89). The brain ^i[(matthaluṅga),] which seems to have been first added as the 32nd part of the body in the Paṭisambhidā (Paṭis I 7), was ignored, and the ^i[Visuddhimagga] is hard put to it to find a use for it. The Piṭakas (e.g. Paṭṭh 1,4 quoted above) connect the mind with the matter of the body without specifying.
^fn27 “It is the mode and the alteration of what? Of consciousness-originated primary elements that have the air-element in excess of capability. What is that capability? It is the state of being consciousness-born and the state of being derived matter. Or alternatively, it can be taken as the mode alteration of the air element. If that is so, then intimation is illogical as derived matter, for there is no derived matter with a single primary as its support, since ‘matter derived from the four great primaries’ (M I 53) is said. That is not wrong. Alteration of one of the four is that of all four, as with wealth shared among four. And excess of air element in a material group ^i[(kalāpa)] does not contradict the words ‘of the air element’; and excess is in capability, not in quantity, otherwise their inseparability would be illogical. According to some it is that of the air element only. In their opinion the state of derived matter is inapplicable ^i[(durupapāda)] to intimation, since the alteration of one is not that of all. But this [air element] is apprehended by mind-door impulsion that is next to the non-intimating [apprehension] that is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion in the movement of the hands, and so on. There is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion. And the apprehension of the former is next to the apprehension of the latter. How is that to be known? By the apprehension of intention. For no apprehension of intention such as, ‘He is getting this done, it seems’ is met with in the case of trees’ movements, etc., which are devoid of intention. But it is met with in the case of hand movements and so on. Therefore there is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion, and it is known as the ‘intimator of the intention.’ Also it is known by inference that the apprehension of the alteration is next to the apprehension of the appearance thus: The intimator intimates the meaning to be intimated only when it is apprehended as a cause, not merely as present. For they say accordingly:
^stz Sounds that have entered no objective field
Do not awaken any kind of meaning;
And also beings merely recognized
As such communicate no meanings either.
“If just the apprehension of the alteration is the reason for the apprehension of the intention, why is there no apprehension of intention in unapprehended communication ^i[(saṅketa)ī] It is not only just the apprehension of the alteration that is the reason for the apprehension of the intention; but rather it should be taken that the apprehension of the previously-established connection is the decisive support for this. The stiffening, upholding, and movement are due to the air-element associated with the alteration belonging to the intimation, is what is said. What, is it all the air-element that does all those things? It is not like that. For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion that, by acquiring as its reinforcing conditions the air elements given rise to by the preceding impulsions, moves consciousness-originated matter by acting as cause for its successive arisings in adjacent locations, ^i[(desantaruppatti]—cf. Ch. VIII, n.54) not the others. The others, however, help it by doing the stiffening and upholding, the successive arising in adjacent locations being itself the movement. So the instrumentality should be taken as attributed when there is the sign [of movement]; otherwise there would not be uninterestedness and momentariness of dhammas. And here the cart to be drawn by seven yokes is given as simile in the Commentary. But when consciousness-born matter moves, the kinds of matter born of temperature, kamma, and nutriment move too because they are bound up with it, like a piece of dry cow-dung thrown into a river’s current.
“Since it has been said that the apprehension of intimation is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion, how then, is the air element itself as the maker of the movement accompanied by the alteration consisting in the intimation? It is not like that. It is the air elements given rise to by the first impulsion, etc., and which are unable to cause movement in that way and perform only the stiffening and upholding, that should be taken as only accompanied by the alteration belonging to intimation. For it is the alteration coexistent with the intention that is the intimation, because of giving rise to alteration in whatever direction it wishes to cause the occurrence of moving forward and so on. Taking it in this way, it is perfectly logical to say that the origination of intimation belongs to mind-door adverting. Since the intention possessed of the aforesaid alteration is intimated through the apprehension of that alteration, it is said that ‘Its function is to display intention.’ The air element being the cause of the motion of the bodily intimation, is figuratively said, as a state of alteration, to be ‘manifested as the cause of bodily motion.’ ‘Its proximate cause is the consciousness-originated air-element’ is said since the air element’s excessive function is the cause of intimating intention by movement of the body” (Vism-mhṭ 450–52). Cf. Dhs-a 83f.
^fn28 ^i[Vacībheda]—”speech utterance” is not in PED, which does not give this use of ^i[bheda.] Vism-mhṭ (p. 452) explains: “The function (—‘knocking together’) of the vocal apparatus (—‘clung-to matter’).”
^fn29 “The question, ‘It is the mode and the alteration of what?,’ should be handled in the same way as for bodily intimation, with this difference: for ‘next to the apprehension of the appearance of movement’ substitute ‘next to the hearing of an audible sound.’ And here, because of the absence of stiffening, etc., the argument beginning, ‘For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion’ does not apply; for the sound arises together with the knocking together, and the knocking together only applies in the case of the first impulsion, and so on. The knocking together is the arising of groups of primaries ^i[(bhūta-kalāpa)] in proximity to each other due to conditions. The movement is the progression of the successive arising in adjacent locations. This is the difference. The earth element’s knocking together is parallel to the air element’s moving as regards function” (Vism-mhṭ 452).
^fn30 In actual fact the ^i[heart-basis] is not in the Piṭakas as such.
^fn31 ^i[“‘Some’] are the inmates of the Abhayagiri Monastery at Anurādhapura” (Vism-mhṭ 455). A long discussion on this follows in Vism-mhṭ,not given here.
^fn32 ^i[“‘Sensed (muta)’] means apprehendable by sensing ^i[(mutvā),] by reaching; hence he said ^i[‘because they are the objective fields of faculties that take contiguous [objective fields]’] (cf. §46). But what is it that is called a tangible datum? It is the three elements, earth, heat, and air. But why is the water element not included here? Is not cold apprehended by touching; and that is the water element? Certainly it is apprehended but it is not the water element. What is it then? It is just the fire element. For there is the sensation ^i[(buddhi)] of cold when heat is sluggish. There is no quality that is called cold; there is only the assumption ^i[(abhimāna)] of coldness due to the sluggishness of the state of heat. How is that to be known? Because of the unreliability of the sensation of cold, like ‘beyond and not beyond.’ For in hot weather, while those who stand in the sun and go into the shade have the sensation of cold, yet those who go to the same place from an underground cave have the sensation of heat. And if coldness were the water element it would be found in a single group ^i[(kalāpa)] along with heat; but it is not so found. That is why it may be known that coldness is not the water element. And that is conclusive ^i[(uttara)] for those who agree to the inseparable existence of the primary elements; and it is conclusive too even for those who do not agree because it is disproved by associate existence through seeing the functions of the four primaries in a single group. It is conclusive too for those who say that coldness is the characteristic of the air element; for if coldness were the air element, coldness would be found in a single group along with heat, and it is not so found. That is why it may be known that coldness is not the air element either. But those who hold the opinion that fluidity ^i[(dravatā)] is the water element and that that is apprehended by touching should be told: ‘That fluidity touched is merely the venerable ones’ assumption as is the case with shape.’ For this is said by the Ancients:
^stz ‘Three elements coexisting with fluidity
Together form what constitutes a tangible;
That “I succeed in touching this fluidity”
Is a common misconception in the world.
And as a man who touches elements,
And apprehends a shape then with his mind,
Fancies “I really have been touching shape,”
So too fluidity is recognized’” (Vism-mhṭ 459).
^fn33 “‘^i[The sound base only]’: here some say, ‘The consciousness-born is always intimative ^i[(saviññattika).’] The Ancients say, ‘There is sound due to the intervention ^i[(vipphāra)] of applied thought that does not intimate.’ While depending on the word of the Great Commentary that puts it thus, ‘Intimatable (cognizable) through the ear by means of the sound due to applied thought’s intervention,’ still there is also need of the arising of consciousness-originated sound without intimation (cognition) for because of the words, ‘For the intimation (cognition) is not due to intimating speech’ (?), it arises together with sound not intimatable (cognizable) through the ear. That being so, there would have to be a consciousness-born sound-ennead. And that theory is rejected by Saṅghakaras who imagine that it is self-contradictory to say that there is sound not intimatable (cognizable) through the ear. Others, however, do not reject the Great Commentary’s statement and they comment on its intention. How? [They say that] the non-intimation (non-cognition) through the ear of the sound activated due to applied thought’s intervention is stated in the Suttas with this intention, ‘He tells by hearing with the divine ear the subtle sound that is conascent with the intimation, originated by applied thought, and consisting in movement of the tongue and palate, and so on’ (cf. A I 171), and that in the Paṭṭhāna (Paṭṭh 1, 7) the state of object condition for ear-consciousness is stated with reference to gross sound” (Vism-mhṭ 460).
^fn34 “‘^i[Has the characteristic of being felt]’ means that it has as its characteristic what is felt, what is experienced as the ‘taste (stimulus)’ of the object. ‘^i[Characteristic of perceiving’] means that it has as its characteristic the perceiving of an object classed as blue, etc., and the knowing, the apprehending, of it by arousing the perception of it as blue, yellow, long, short, and so on. Forming ^i[(abhisaṅkharaṇa)] is accumulating, or it is contriving by becoming interested. And it is because volition is basic in both of these ways that the formations aggregate is said thus to have the ^i[characteristic of forming.] For in expounding the formations aggregate in the Suttanta-Bhājaniya of the Vibhaṅga, volition was expounded by the Blessed One thus, ‘Eye-contact-born volition’ (Vibh 8) and so on. ‘^i[Has the characteristic of cognizing]’ means that it has as its characteristic that kind of knowing called apprehension of an object in a mode in which the objective field is apprehended differently from the mode of perceiving” (Vism-mhṭ 462).
^fn35 ^i[Profitable] in the sense of health, blamelessness, and pleasant result (see Vism- mhṭ 463). ^i[Unprofitable] in the opposite sense. ^i[Indeterminate] because not describable as either profitable or unprofitable (see Vism-mhṭ 464). This is the first of the twenty- two triads in the Abhidhamma Mātikā (Dhs 1).
Pali has five principal words, ^i[nāma, viññāṇa, mano, citta,] and ^i[ceto,] against the normal English ^i[consciousness] and ^i[mind.]While their etymology can be looked up in the dictionary, one or two points need noting here. ^i[Nāma] (rendered by “mentality” when not used to refer to a ^i[name]) is almost confined in the sense considered to the expression ^i[nāma-rūpa] (“mentality-materiality”) as the fourth member of the dependent origination, where it comprises the three mental aggregates of feeling, perception and formations, but not that of consciousness (^i[viññāṇa]). ^i[Viññāṇa] (rendered by “consciousness”) is, loosely, more or less a synonym for ^i[mano] and ^i[citta]; technically, it is bare cognition considered apart from feeling, perception or formations. ^i[Mano] (rendered by “mind”), when used technically, is confined to the sixth internal base for contact (Ch. XV). ^i[Citta] (rendered by “mind” and “consciousness” or “[manner of] consciousness”), when used technically, refers to a momentary type-situation considered as ^i[viññāṇa] in relation to the tone of its concomitant feeling, perception and formations. Possibly, a better rendering would have been “cognizance” throughout. It carries a flavour of its etymological relative, ^i[cetanā] (“volition”). ^i[Ceto] (another etymological relative, rendered by “heart”—i.e. “seat of the emotions,”—“will” or “mind”), when used loosely is very near to ^i[citta;] but technically it is restricted to one or two such expressions as ^i[ceto- vimutti] (“mind-deliverance” or “heart-deliverance”).
^fn36 “‘Sense sphere’ ^i[(kāmāvacara):] here there are the two kinds of sense desire ^i[(kāma),] sense desire as basis ^i[(vatthu-kāma)] and sense desire as defilement ^i[(kilesakāma).] Of these, sense desire as [objective] basis particularized as the five cords of sense desire ^i[(pañca-kāma-guṇa] = dimensions of sensual desires), is desired ^i[(kāmiyati).] Sense desire as defilement, which is craving, desires ^i[(kāmeti).] The sense sphere ^i[(kāmāvacara)] is where these two operate ^i[(avacaranti)] together. But what is that? It is the elevenfold sense-desire becoming, i.e. hell, asura demons, ghosts, animals, human beings, and six sensual-sphere heavens. So too with the fine-material sphere and the immaterial sphere, taking “fine-material” as craving for the fine-material too, and “immaterial” as craving for the immaterial too. It crosses over ^i[(uttarati)] from the world ^i[(loka),] thus it is supramundane ^i[(lokuttara)”] (Vism-mhṭ 464).
^fn37 The meaning of the expression ^i[tathābhāva-paccupaṭṭhāna] appears more clearly where it is used again at §108. In this definition ^i[(sādhana)] the function ^i[(kicca-rasa)] in fact describes the verb action ^i[(kicca)] while the manifestation ^i[(paccupaṭṭhāna)] describes the relevant nounal state ^i[(bhāva).] So ^i[“tathābhāva”] means that what has just been taken as a function (e.g. “receiving”) is to be taken also as a state (“reception”).
^fn38 “To the six kinds of objects all classed as limited, etc., past, etc., internal, etc” (Vism-mhṭ 474).
^fn39 Registration consciousness does not, it is stated, occur with an object of exalted consciousness—see Vibh-a 154.
^fn40 “‘^i[The source it has come from, and so on’] means the source it has come from and its condition. Here, in the opinion of certain teachers the result of the unprompted profitable is unprompted and the result of the prompted is prompted, like the movement of the face’s reflection in a looking-glass when the face moves; thus it is ^i[due to the source it has come from.] But in the opinion of other teachers the unprompted arises due to powerful kamma as condition and the prompted does so due to weak kamma; thus it is ^i[due to its condition]” (Vism-mhṭ 474).
^fn41 “With respect to such unsublime objects as the forms of skeletons or ghosts” (Vism-mhṭ 476). See e.g. Vin III 104.
^fn42 See also M-a IV 124f. “Here ^i[‘kamma’] is stored-up profitable kamma of the sense sphere that has got an opportunity to ripen; hence he said ‘^i[that has appeared.’ ‘Sign of kamma’] is the gift to be given that was a condition for the volition at the moment of accumulating the kamma. ^i[‘Sign of destiny’] is the visible-data base located in the destiny in which he is about to be reborn” (Vism-mhṭ 477). See XVII. 136ff.
^fn43 “‘^i[The sign of kamma]” here is only the kamma’s own object consisting of an earth kasiṇa, etc” (Vism-mhṭ 478).
^fn44 “‘^i[With that same object’]: if kamma is the life-continuum’s object, then it is that kamma; if the sign of the kamma, or the sign of the destiny, then it is one of those” (Vism-mhṭ 478).
^fn45 “‘^i[Occurring endlessly’]: this is, in fact, thus called ^i[‘bhavaṅga’] (life-continuum, lit. ‘limb’ (or ‘practice’—see II. 11) of becoming) because of its occurring as the state of an ^i[aṅga] (‘limb’ or ‘practice’) of the rebirth-process becoming ^i[(uppatti-bhava)”] (Vism-mhṭ 478).
For the commentarial description of dream consciousness and kamma effected during dreams, see Vibh-a (commentary to Ñāṇa-Vibhaṅga, Ekaka) and A-a, (commentary to AN 5:196) which largely but not entirely overlap. Vism-mhṭ says here: “The seeing of dreams is done with consciousness consisting only of the functional” (Vism-mhṭ 478).
^fn46 “‘^i[A disturbance in the life-continuum]’ is a wavering of the life-continuum consciousness; the meaning is that there is the arrival at a state that is a reason for dissimilarity in its occurrence twice in that way. For it is called disturbance ^i[(calana)] because it is like a disturbance (movement) since there seems to be a cause for an occasion ^i[(avatthā)] in the mind’s continuity different from the previous occasion. Granted, firstly, that there is impact on the sensitivity owing to confrontation with an object, since the necessity for that is established by the existence of the objective field and the possessor of the objective field, but how does there come to be disturbance (movement) of the life-continuum that has a different support? Because it is connected with it. And here the example is this: when grains of sugar are put on the surface of a drum and one of the grains of sugar is tapped, a fly sitting on another grain of sugar moves” (Vism-mhṭ 478).
^fn47 “‘^i[Next to adverting]’ means next to five-door adverting. For those who do not admit the cognitive series beginning with receiving, just as they do not admit the heart basis, the Pali has been handed down in various places in the way beginning, ‘For the eye-consciousness element as receiving ^i[(sampaṭicchanāya cakkhuviññāṇa- dhātuyā)’] (see Ch. IV, n. 13); for the Pali cannot be contradicted” (Vism-mhṭ 479). The quotation as it stands is not traced to the Piṭakas.
^fn48 See Ch. IV, note 13.
^fn49 “‘^i[If … vivid (lit. large)’:] this is said because it is the occurrence of consciousness at the end of the impulsions that is being discussed. For an object is here intended as ‘vivid’ when its life is fourteen conscious moments; and that should be understood as coming into focus when it has arisen and is two or three moments past” (Vism-mhṭ 479).
^fn50 “This includes also the preliminary-work and the cleansing (see Ch. XXII, note 7), not change-of-lineage only” (Vism-mhṭ 479). See also IV.74 and XXI. 129.
^fn51 “‘^i[That obtains a condition’:] any impulsion that has obtained a condition for arising next to change-of-lineage, as that of the fine-material sphere, and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 479).
^fn52 “‘^i[A very vivid one]’ is one with a life of sixteen conscious moments. For registration consciousness arises with respect to that, not with respect to any other. ^i[‘Clear’] means very evident, and that is only in the sense sphere; for registration arises with respect to that” (Vism-mhṭ 479).
^fn53 “‘^i[Previous kamma’:] this is said in order to show the differences in kinds of registration; for kamma that generates rebirth-linking is not the only kind to generate registration; other kinds of kamma do so too. But the latter generates registration unlike that generatable by the kamma that generates rebirth-linking.^i[‘Impulsion consciousness’:] this is said in order to show what defines the registration; for it is said, ‘Registration is definable by impulsion’ (?). The word ‘etc.’ includes rebirth-linking, however; for that is not a condition for registration that is more outstanding than itself. ^i[‘Any condition’:] any condition from among the desirable objects, etc., that has combined ^i[(samaveta)] to produce the arising of registration” (Vism-mhṭ 479).
^fn54 “This should be regarded as a secondary characteristic ^i[(upalakkhaṇa)] of profitable feeling, that is to say, the fact that whatever profitable feeling there is, is all associated with profitable consciousness. That, however, is not for the purpose of establishing its profitableness. For the profitableness of profitable feeling is not due to its association with profitable consciousness, but rather to wise attention and so on. That is why he said ^i[‘as to kind.’] So too in the case of the unprofitable and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 481).
^fn55 ^i[Sambhoga—“exploiting”:] not in this sense in PED (see also XVII.51).
^fn56 “Pleasure and pain respectively gratify and afflict by acting in one way on the body and in another way on the mind, but not so equanimity, which is why the latter is described as of one class.
“Just as, when a man places a piece of cotton wool on an anvil and strikes it with an iron hammer, and his hammer goes right through the cotton and hits the anvil, the violence of the blow is great, so too because the violence of the impact’s blow is great, body-consciousness is accompanied by pleasure when the object is a desirable or desirable-neutral one, and by pain when the object is an undesirable or undesirable- neutral one. [It is the impact of primary matter (tangible object) on the primaries of the body.]
“Herein, though profitable-resultant and unprofitable-resultant consciousness discriminated according to the desirable and undesirable might logically be associated with pleasure and pain, nevertheless the eight kinds of consciousness that have the eye, etc., as their support ((34)–(37) and (50)–(53)) are invariably associated only with equanimity, because of the gentleness of the impact’s blow in the case of two instances of derived matter, like that of two pieces of cotton wool” (Vism-mhṭ 482). For a simile see Dhs-a 263.
^fn57 “‘^i[The characteristic of agglomerating]’ means the characteristic of adding together ^i[(sampiṇḍana);] then they are said to have the function of accumulating, for the dhammas in the formations aggregate are so described because volition is their basis” (Vism- mhṭ 484).
^fn58 ^i[Vipphāra]—“intervening” here is explained by Vism-mhṭ (p. 484) as ^i[vyāpāra] (interest or work); not in this sense in PED. See Ch. VI, note 6.
^fn59 ^i[Yevāpanaka (ye-vā-pana-ka)] is commentarial shorthand derived from the Dhammasaṇgaṇī phrase ^i[“ye-vā-pana tasmií samaye aññe pi atthi paṭiccasamuppannā arūpino dhammā]”—“Or whatever other immaterial conditionally-arisen states (phenomena) there are too on that occasion” (Dhs 1). Cf. also M I 85.
^fn60 “‘^i[As the act of touching too’:] by this he shows that this is its individual essence even though it is immaterial. And the characteristic of touching is obvious in its occurrence in such instances as, say, the watering of the mouth in one who sees another tasting vinegar or a ripe mango, the bodily shuddering in a sympathetic person who sees another being hurt, the trembling of the knees in a timid man standing on the ground when he sees a man precariously balanced on a high tree branch, the loss of power of the legs in one who sees something terrifying such as a ^i[pisāca](goblin)” (Vism-mhṭ 484–85).
^fn61 For “non-adherent” see §46. “‘^i[On any one side’] means on any one side of itself, like a pair of planks and so on. ^i[‘Non-adherent’] means not sticking ^i[(asaísilissamāna).] It is only the impact without adherence that contact shares with visible data and sound, not the objective field. Just as, though eye and ear are non-adherent respectively to visible data and sounds still they have the word ‘touched’ used of them, so too it can be said of contact’s touching and impinging on the object. Contact’s impinging is the actual concurrence (meeting) of consciousness and object” (Vism-mhṭ 485).
^fn62 ^i[Adhiṭṭhāna]—“habitat” (or site or location or foundation): this meaning not given in PED.
^fn63 The four factors of stream-entry (see S V 347) are: waiting on good men, hearing the Good Dhamma, wise attention, and practice in accordance with the Dhamma. Again they are: absolute confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and possession of noble virtue (S V 343).
^fn64 “^i[Apilāpana (‘not wobbling’)] is the steadying of an object, the remembering and not forgetting it, keeping it as immovable as a stone instead of letting it go bobbing about like a pumpkin in water” (Vism-mhṭ 487).
^fn65 “And here by tranquilization, etc., of consciousness only consciousness is tranquillized and becomes light, malleable, wieldy, proficient and upright. But with tranquilization, etc., of the [mental] body also the material body is tranquillized, and so on. This is why the twofoldness of states is given by the Blessed One here, but not in all places” (Vism-mhṭ 489).
^fn66 “‘^i[The act of resolving’] should be understood as the act of being convinced ^i[(sanniṭṭhāna)]about an object, not as trusting ^i[(pasādana)”] (Vism-mhṭ 489). See §140.
^fn67 “Because the path consciousnesses have Nibbāna as their object and because compassion, gladness, etc., have living beings as their object, there is no compassion, etc., in the path” (Vism-mhṭ 491).
^fn68 ”Because the paralysis ^i[(saíhanana)] of consciousness comes about through stiffness, but that of matter through torpor like that of the three aggregates beginning with feeling, therefore torpor is manifested as nodding and sleep” (Vism-mhṭ 493).
^fn69 ^i[Kukata] is not in PED. It is impossible to render into English this “portmanteau” etymology, e.g. ^i[kucchita-kata—kukata, kukutatā] … ^i[kukkucca,] which depends mostly on a fortuitous parallelism of meaning and verbal forms in the Pali. While useless to strict modern etymologists, it has a definite semantic and mnemonic use.
^fn70 “‘^i[Mere steadiness in occurrence]’ is mere presence for a moment. That it is only “mere steadiness in occurrence” owing to the mere condition for the steadiness of the mind ^i[(ceto)] is because of lack of real steadiness due to absence of decidedness ^i[(nicchaya),] and it is incapable of being a condition for such steadiness in continuity (see §188) as the steadiness of consciousness stated thus: ‘like the steadiness of a flame sheltered from a draught’ (XIV.139)” (Vism-mhṭ 495).
^fn71 “Here when the time is delimited by death and rebirth-linking the term ‘extent’ is applicable. It is made known through the Suttas in the way beginning ‘Was I in the past?’ (M I 8); for the past state is likewise mentioned as ‘extent’ in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta too in the way beginning, ‘He does not follow what is past (the past extent)’ (M III 1 88). But when it is delimited in the ultimate sense as in the Addhāniruttipatha Sutta thus, ‘Bhikkhus, there are three extents, the past extent, the future extent, and the present extent’ (It 53), then it is appropriate as delimited by moment. Herein, the existingness of the present is stated thus, ‘Bhikkhus, of matter that is born … manifested, it is said that: “It exists”’ (S IV 72), and pastness and futureness are respectively called before and after that” (Vism-mhṭ 496).
^fn72 “Cold temperature is like with cold, and hot with hot. But that temperature which falls on the body, whether hot or cold, and occurs as a continuity in one mode, being neither less nor more, is called ‘single temperature.’ The word ‘single’ is used because of the plurality of ‘like’ temperature. So too with nutriment. ^i[‘In one cognitive series, in one impulsion’] refers respectively to five-door and mind-door consciousness. The explanations of ^i[continuity] and ^i[period] are given in the Commentaries for the purpose of helping the practice of insight” (Vism-mhṭ 496).
^fn73 In these two paragraphs “^i[past]” and “^i[future]” refer not to time, as in the other paragraphs, but to the materiality.
^fn74 “‘^i[Cause’ (hetu)] is what gives birth ^i[(janaka); ‘condition’ (paccaya)] is what consolidates ^i[(upatthambhaka).] Their respective functions are arousing and consolidating. Just as the seed’s function is to arouse the sprout and that of the earth, etc., is to consolidate it, and just as kamma’s function is to arouse result as matter that is due to kamma performed, and that of nutriment is to consolidate it, so the function of those [conditions] that give birth to each material group and each thought-arising and serve as kamma and proximity-conditions, etc., for them, and the function of those that consolidate them and serve as conascence, prenascence, and postnascence conditions for them may be construed accordingly as appropriate.
“Because there is similarity and dissimilarity in temperature, etc., in the way stated, the pastness, etc., of material instances originated by it are stated according to continuity. But there is no such similarity and dissimilarity in the kamma that gives birth to a single becoming, so instead of stating according to continuity the pastness, etc., of material instances originated by that, it is stated according to what consolidates. However, when there comes to be reversal of sex, then the male sex disappears owing to powerful unprofitable kamma, and the female sex appears owing to weak profitable kamma; and the female sex disappears owing to weak unprofitable kamma, while the male sex appears owing to powerful profitable kamma (see Dhs-a 321). So there is in fact dissimilarity in what is originated by kamma and consequent dissimilarity in what is past, etc., in accordance with the continuity of these as well. But it is not included because it does not happen always” (Vism-mhṭ 497).
^fn75 ^i[Niyakajjhatta]—“internally in the sense of one’s own”: four kinds of ^i[ajjhatta] (internal, lit. “belonging to oneself”) are mentioned in the commentaries and sub-commentaries (see Dhs-a 46): ^i[gocarajjhatta]—internally as range or resort (M-a IV 161; II 90, 292), ^i[ajjhattajjhata]—internally as such (Vism-mhṭ 152), ^i[niyakajjhatta]—internally in the sense of one’s own (IV.141, IX.114, this ref.; M-a IV 161), ^i[visayajjhatta]—internally as objective field (M-a IV 160).
^fn76 Profitable result is superior because it produces a desirable object (see Vism- mhṭ 498). This question is treated at length at Vibh-a 9f.
^fn77 “The feeling that accompanies the faith, etc., occurring in one who sees an image of the Buddha or who hears the Dhamma, even for a whole day, is ‘present’” (Vism- mhṭ 499).
^fn78 “Consciousness dominates because of the words, ‘Dhammas have mind as their forerunner’ (Dhp l), ‘Dhammas (states) that have parallel turn-over with consciousness’ (Dhs §1522), and ‘The king, lord of the six doors (?)’” (Vism-mhṭ 503).
^fn79 ^i[Sammohavinodanī](Be) (Khandha Vibhaṅga Commentary) in the identical passage, reads ^i[vedanādayo anāsavā pi sāsavā pi atthi.] Ee and Ae read ^i[vedanādayo anāsavā pi atthi].
^fn80 ^i[Avarodha]—“inclusion”: not in PED. The term ^i[etaparama]—“the widest limit” is not mentioned in PED. See M I 80, 339; S V 119; M-a III, 281. Cf. also ^i[etāvaparama,] M I 246.
^fn81 “When all formed dhammas are grouped together according to similarity, they naturally fall into five aggregates. Herein, it is the items that are the same owing to the sameness consisting respectively in ‘molesting,’ etc., that are to be understood as ‘similar.’ Among them, those that are strong in the volition whose nature is accumulating with the function of forming the formed, are called the formations aggregate. And the others, that is, contact, etc., which are devoid of the distinguishing characteristics of ‘being molested,’ etc., may also be so regarded under the generality of forming the formed. But the similarities consisting in touching are not describable separately by the word ‘aggregate,’ and so that is why no aggregates of contact, etc., have been stated by the Perfect One who knows the similarities of dhammas. ‘Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmans there are who are asserters of eternity and declare the self and the world to be eternal, all do so depending and relying on these same five aggregates or on one or other of them’ (cf. S IV 46), and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 503).
^fn82 The aggregates of virtue, concentration, understanding, liberation, and knowledge and vision of liberation (S I 99), etc.
^fn83 “The matter of the body is like the ^i[prison] because it is the site of the punishment. ^i[Perception is like the offence] because owing to perception of beauty, etc., it is a cause of the ^i[punishment,] which is ^i[feeling.] The ^i[formations aggregate] is like the ^i[punisher] because it is a cause of feeling. ^i[Consciousness] is like the ^i[offender] because it is afflicted by feeling. Again, ^i[matter] is like the ^i[dish] because it bears the food. ^i[Perception] is like the ^i[curry sauce] because, owing to perception of beauty, etc., it hides the ^i[food,] which is ^i[feeling.] The ^i[formations aggregate] is like the ^i[server] because it is a cause of ^i[feeling;] and service is included since one who is taking a meal is usually served. ^i[Consciousness] is like the ^i[eater] because it is helped by feeling” (Vism-mhṭ 504). For ^i[cāraka] (prison) see XVI.18.
^fn84 Ee and Ae both read ^i[visesato ca sūḷāram pi ajjhattikaí rūpaí.] But ^i[Sammohavinodanī] (Be) in identical passage reads ^i[visesato ca subhārammaṇam pi oḷārikam pi ajjhattika-rūpaí].
^c15
^fn1 The following words in §3 are not in PED: ^i[cakkhati] (it relishes), ^i[rūpayati] (it makes visible—only referred to under ^i[rūpa]), ^i[sappati] (it is emitted; pass. of ^i[sapati], to swear (Ud 45)), ^i[udāhariyati] (it is uttered, lit. “is carried up to”), ^i[gandhayati] (it is smelt), ^i[sūcayati] (it betrays), ^i[rasati] (it tastes). Be ed. of Vibh-a reads ^i[manayati] (not in PED) for ^i[muṇāti] in parallel passage.
Vism-mhṭ (p. 508) explains ^i[cakkhati] (relishes) semantically by “tasting a flavour as in ‘relishing’ honey or sauce” and cites M I 503. Linguistically it connects the word with ^i[ācikkhati] (to show).
“When a visible form (^i[rūpa]) undergoes, like the visible aspect of a chameleon, an alteration in appearance (colour) at times when [the mind is] dyed with greed or corrupted with hate, etc., it makes visible what state [is prevalent] in the heart (i.e. the mind) and makes that evident as though it were an actual visible object; the meaning is that it demonstrates it by giving it, as it were, a graspable entity (^i[saviggaha]). Or the word rūpa means demonstration, and that is the same as evidencing. Or the word ^i[rūpa] can be regarded as evidencing of elements too, since it has many meanings. ^i[Rūpayati] (it makes visible) is a derivative (^i[nibbacana]) of the word ^i[rūpa] that expresses appearance (colour), while ^i[ruppati] (it is molested) is a derivative that expresses the materiality aggregate. [As to sound] only the sound of words (^i[vacana-sadda]) would be covered by the meaning ‘^i[is uttered (udāhariyati]),’ and here sound is not only the sound of words, but rather all that can be cognized by the ear is what ‘^i[is emitted (sappati])’; the meaning is that by means of its own conditions it is emitted (^i[sappiyati]), is made cognizable by the ear” (Vism-mhṭ 508) (cf. also ^i[sappari], to crawl). “‘It ^i[evokes life (jīvitaí avhayati])’ owing to appetite for tastes in food (^i[āhāra]), which is the cause of life (^i[jīvita]), since the act of swallowing is rooted in approval of tastes. This is the linguistic characteristic of the word^i[jivhā] (tongue)” (Vism-mhṭ 509).
^fn2 The following words in §4 are not in PED: ^i[āyatana] (actuating: verbal n. fm. ^i[āyatati], to actuate); ^i[tanana] (range: verbal n. fm. ^i[tanoti], to provide a range for, to extend—q.v. PED—; mentioned under ^i[āyatana], base); ^i[nayana] (lead in on: verbal n. fm. ^i[neti], to lead on; lit, meaning not in PED);^i[āyatati] (to actuate—^i[cakkhuviññāṇādīnaí uppādanaí āyatanaí], Vism-mhṭ). See also ^i[āyāpenti] Paṭis II 21.
^fn3 ^i[Ākara] means either a mine or a store (PED apparently believes in mining for pearls—see ^i[ratanākara]).
^fn4 “Because of the absence of anything whatever not included in the twelve bases, there is no arguing that they are more than twelve” (Vism-mhṭ 510).
^fn5 “‘^i[In other words, the life-continuum mind]’: that which occurs twice in disturbance (see Ch. XIV, note 46). Only when there has been the occurrence of the life-continuum in a state of disturbance (in a state of dissimilar occurrence) is there the arising of adverting, not otherwise. Taking it thus as the reason for adverting, what is called ‘life-continuum mind’ is a door of arising. ‘^i[Not common to all]’ means not common to eye-consciousness and the rest” (Vism-mhṭ 510). See M I 293.
^fn6 “‘^i[Condition]’ is kamma, etc., ‘destiny’ is from hell upwards; ‘order [^i[of beings]]’ refers to such species as elephants, horses, etc., or to the castes of the khattiyas (warrior nobles), and so on; ‘^i[person]’ refers to any given living being’s continuity” (Vism-mhṭ 511).
^fn7 There are eighty-one mundane sorts of consciousness; and since there is no path or fruition without jhāna, when the four paths and four fruitions are multiplied by the five jhānas, there are forty kinds of supramundane consciousness: 81+40 = 121.
^fn8 “‘^i[Physical basis]’ is that consisting of the eye, etc.; according to that ‘^i[Progress]’ is a painful progress, and the other three. ‘^i[And so on]’ refers to jhāna, predominance, plane, object, and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 512).
^fn9 “Blue is similar to blue; it is dissimilar to any other colour. ‘^i[Condition]’ is kamma, and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 512).
^fn10 The verb^i[dahati], the basis of all these derivatives, means literally “to put.” “There are five meanings stated, since the word ^i[dhātu] (element, sort, ‘putting’) has its form established (^i[siddha]) here by (a) the transitive (^i[kattu]), (b) the intransitive (^i[kamma]), (c) the abstract noun (^i[bhāva]), (d) the instrumental case (^i[kāraṇa]), and (e) the causative voice (^i[adhikaraṇa]). Supramundane elements do not sort out (^i[vidahanti]) the suffering of the round of rebirths; on the contrary, they destroy (^i[vidhaísenti]) it. That is why ‘^i[mundane’] is specified” (Vism-mhṭ 513).
^fn11 “‘^i[Are elements since they cause [a state’s] own individual essence to be borne]’: here, while the establishment of the word’s form should be understood as “^i[dadhātī ti dhātu] (it puts, sorts, thus it is an element),’ still taking the word ^i[dhā] to share the meanings [of both ^i[dadhāti] and
^i[dhāreti] (see XI.104)], there is also the meaning of the active voice different from the first, because the meanings of ^i[vidhāna] (sorting out) and ^i[dhāraṇa] (causing to bear) are unconnected. The causing of the bearing of mere individual essences without any permanent living being, is a basic meaning of the word ^i[dhātu] (element), and so it is stated separately” (Vism-mhṭ 513).
^fn12 “‘^i[Are elements like those elements]’: here, just as the word “lion” (^i[sīha]), which is properly applicable to the bearer of a mane, [is used] of a man, so too the word ‘element,’ which is properly applicable to the constituents of marble, is used of the eye and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 513).
^fn13 “‘^i[Successive definition of cause and fruit]’ is just the state of cause and fruit” (Vism- mhṭ 514).
^fn14 “It is the mere cessation of the mind-consciousness element and mental-data element because it is the ceasedness of thought-arisings in the fourth immaterial state” (Vism-mhṭ 514).
^fn15 In XIV.35–70, the material instances listed total 28, that is, 4 primary elements, 9 sense faculties (excluding the tangible-data faculty, which is the 3 elements except water), and 15 kinds of subtle materiality beginning with the femininity faculty (cf. treatment at Dhs §596). Other lists, however, sometimes give a total of 26 kinds, that is, 10 sense faculties (including the tangible-data faculty, which is the 3 primary elements) and 16 kinds of subtle materiality, that is, the above-mentioned 15 plus the water element, which is listed then after the space element (cf. treatment at Dhs §653 and list at M-a II 261). See Table I.
^fn16 “Here the word ‘etc.’ stands for the mind-consciousness element’s states where suitable as root-cause, predominance, kamma, kamma-result, nutriment, faculty, jhāna, and path conditions” (Vism-mhṭ 516).
^fn17 “I.e. subtle materiality and Nibbāna” (Vism-mhṭ 516).
^fn18 “‘^i[Life-continuum mind]’ is the life-continuum consciousness occurring twice in disturbance” (Vism-mhṭ 516).
^fn19 “Formed elements are secluded in both instances (i.e. when past and future) because their individual essences are unapprehendable then” (Vism-mhṭ 516).
^fn20 ^i[Adharāraṇi (adho-araṇi])—“lower fire-stick” and ^i[uttarāraṇi (uttara-araṇi])—“upper fire-stick” are not in PED as such.
^c16
^fn1 “In the noble path moment’s initial stage” (Vism-mhṭ 519).
^fn2 The words ^i[iṭṭha] (prepared—^i[sajjita, uppādita] Vism-mhṭ 520), and ^i[juṭṭha] (fostered—^i[sevita], Vism-mhṭ 520) are not in PED. The Pali is: ^i[indaliṅgaṭṭho indriyaṭṭho, indadesitaṭṭho indriyaṭṭho, indadiṭṭhaṭṭho indriyaṭṭho, indasiṭṭhaṭṭho indriyaṭṭho, indajuṭṭhaṭṭho indriyaṭṭho]; cf. ^i[Pāṇini]V 2,93: ^i[Indriyam indraliṅgam indradṛṣṭam indrasṛṣṭam indrajuṣṭam indradattam iti vā].
^fn3 ^i[Anuvattāpana]—“causing occurrence parallel to”: not in PED; not in CPD.
^fn4 ^i[Aya]—“reason”: not in PED in this sense.
^fn5 ^i[Cāraka]—“prison”: not in PED in this sense; see XIV.221.
^fn6 “‘^i[Signless]’: being secluded from the sign of the five aggregates, it is taken as having no graspable entity (^i[aviggaha])” (Vism-mhṭ 525).
^fn7 “Sickness is not included here (as at D II 305 for example) because no particular person is meant, and there are persons in whom sickness does not arise at all, like the venerable Bakkula (MN 124); otherwise it may be taken as already included by suffering itself; for in the ultimate sense sickness is bodily pain conditioned by disturbance of elements” (Vism-mhṭ 527).
^fn8 “The question, “^i[But why is it suffering]?” means this: granted firstly that birth in hell is painful, since hell is unalloyed pain, and that it is painful in the other unhappy destinies since it is originated by bad kamma; but how is it so in the happy destinies since it is there originated by kamma that leads to bliss? The answer, “^i[Because it is the basis for many kinds of suffering]”, etc., shows that this birth is not called suffering because of having suffering as its individual essence—for there is no rebirth^i[-]linking associated with painful feeling—but rather because it is the foundation for suffering” (Vism-mhṭ 528).
Something must be said here about the words ^i[dukkha] and ^i[sukha,] the former being perhaps the hardest after ^i[dhamma] to render into English. ^i[Dukkha] is consistently rendered by either the vaguer general term “suffering” or by the more specific “[bodily] pain.” Different, but overlapping, ideas are expressed. The latter needs no explanation; but “suffering” must be stretched to include the general insecurity of the whole of experience, of the impermanent world. For this, “uneasiness” would certainly be preferable (“ill” is sometimes used), but multiplication of renderings is to be avoided as much as possible; local accuracy is only too often gained at the cost of general disorientation in a work of this sort, with these very general words capable of sharp focusing. Again, ^i[sukha] has been rendered as either “bliss” or “pleasure,” though the latter does not at all necessarily imply any hedonism construed with sensual pleasure (^i[kāma]). Again, “ease” (in the sense of relief) is in many ways preferable for the first sense but has not been used for the reason already given.
^fn9 “Since also what does not have suffering as its individual essence is yet called suffering indirectly, consequently ‘intrinsic suffering’ (^i[dukkha-dukkha]) is said particularizing what does have suffering as its individual essence, just as in the case of particularizing ‘concrete matter’” (^i[rūpa-rūpa]) (see 14.77) (Vism-mhṭ 528). For these three kinds see S IV 259.
^fn10 See MN 13 and 129, though it is not clear where the figure “thirty-two” is taken from.
^fn11 ^i[Pavana]—“stench”: not in PED, in this sense. The ^i[Sammohavinodanī] (Be) reproducing this passage inserts the word^i[asuci] (impurity), lacking in Ee and Ae eds. of Vism. ^i[Kuṇapa] is only given the meaning of “corpse or carcass” in PED; but Vism-mhṭ says, “various ordures (^i[kuṇapa]) such as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, excrement, gorge and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 529). “Whether the mother is [twenty], [thirty], or [forty] years old, it is ‘^i[as exceptionally loathsome]’ as an excrement bucket that has not been washed for a like number of years” (Vism-mhṭ 529).
^fn12 Ee and Ae read ^i[uddhapādaí] (or ^i[uddhaí pādaí) papatanti,] but Vibh-a (Be) reads ^i[chinnapapātaí papatanti.] The former reading is favoured by Vism-mhṭ.
^fn13 Vibh-a (Be) adds ^i[telādīnaí;] not in Ee and Ae texts.
^fn14 ^i[Anutthunana]—“brooding”: not in PED = ^i[anto nijjhāyana] (Vism-mhṭ 532).
^fn15 “Just as a lion directs his strength against the man who shot the arrow at him, not against the arrow, so the Buddhas deal with the cause, not with the fruit. But just as dogs, when struck with a clod, snarl and bite the clod and do not attack the striker, so the sectarians who want to make suffering cease devote themselves to mutilating the body, not to causing cessation of defilements” (Vism-mhṭ 533).
^fn16 “‘^i[On coming to that (taí āgamma])’: on reaching that Nibbāna by making it the object” (Vism-mhṭ 533). ^i[Āgamma] (ger. of ^i[āgacchati]—to come) is commonly used as an adverb in the sense of “owing to” (e.g. at M I 119). Here, however, it is taken literally by the Commentaries and forms an essential part of the ontological proof of the positive existence of Nibbāna. The ^i[Sammohavinodanī] (commentary on the Āyatana-Vibhaṅga Abhidhamma-bhājaniya) refutes the suggestion of a disputant (^i[vitaṇḍavādin]) who asserts that Nibbāna is “mere destruction” (^i[khayamatta]). The arguments used are merely supplementary to those in §69 here, and so are not quoted. The conclusion of the argument is worth noting, however, because of the emphasis on the words “^i[taí āgamma].” It is this: “It is on coming to Nibbāna that greed, etc., are destroyed. It is the same Nibbāna that is called ‘destruction of greed, destruction of hate, destruction of delusion.’ These are just three terms for Nibbāna—When this was said, he asked: You say ‘On coming to’ (^i[āgamma]); from where have you got this ‘on coming to’?—It is got from the Suttas—Quote the sutta—‘Thus ignorance and craving, on coming to that, are destroyed in that, are abolished in that, nor does anything anywhere … (^i[evaí avijjā ca taṇhā ca taí āgamma tamhi khīṇaí tamhi bhaggaí na ca kiñci kadāci] … ).’ When this was said, the other was silent.” The quotation has not been traced.
^fn17 ^i[Nippapañca] (non-diversification) is one of the synonyms for Nibbāna. The word ^i[papañca] is commonly used in the Commentaries in the sense (a) of an impediment or obstacle (Dhp-a I 18), and (b) as a delay, or diffuseness (XVII.73). The sense in which the word is used in the Suttas is that of diversifying and is best exemplified at M I 111: “Friends, due to eye and to a visible object eye-consciousness arises. The coincidence of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What a man feels that he perceives. What he perceives he thinks about. What he thinks about he diversifies (^i[papañceti]). Owing to his having diversified, the evaluation of diversifying perceptions besets a man with respect to past, future, and present visible objects,” and so on. This kind of ^i[papañca] is explained by the Commentaries as “due to craving, pride and views” (M-a I 25; II 10; II 75, etc.), and it may be taken as the diversifying action, the choosing and rejecting, the approval and disapproval (M I 65), exercised by craving, etc., on the bare material supplied by perception and thought. Consequently, though it is bound up with craving, etc., a false emphasis is given in rendering ^i[papañca] in these contexts by “obsession” as is done in PED. ^i[Nippapañca] as a term for Nibbāna emphasizes the absence of that.
^fn18 This discussion falls under three headings: Questions one to four refute the assertion that Nibbāna is mythical and non-existent; questions five to seven refute the assertion that Nibbāna is “mere destruction;” (further argued in the ^i[Sammohavinodanī]— Vibh-a 51f.) the remaining questions deal with the proof that only Nibbāna (and not the atom, etc.,) is permanent because uncreated.
The ^i[Paramatthamañjūsā] (Vism-mhṭ) covers the subject at great length and reinforces the arguments given here with much syllogistic reasoning. However, only the following paragraph will be quoted here, which is reproduced in the commentaries to Ud 80 and It 37. (The last sentence marked ** appears only in the Udāna Commentary. Readings vary considerably):
“Now, in the ultimate sense the existingness of the Nibbāna-element has been demonstrated by the Fully Enlightened One, compassionate for the whole world, by many sutta passages such as ‘Dhammas without condition,’ ‘Unformed dhammas’ (see Dhs 2), ‘Bhikkhus, there is that base (sphere) where neither earth … ’ (Ud 80), ‘This state is very hard to see, that is to say, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all substance of becoming’ (D II 36; M I 167), ‘Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the unformed and the way leading to the unformed’ (S IV 362), and so on, and in this sutta, ‘Bhikkhus, there is an unborn …” (It 87; Ud 80). So even if the wise trust completely in the Dispensation and have no doubts, though they may not yet have had direct perception of it, nevertheless there are persons who come to understand through another’s guidance (reading ^i[paraneyya-buddhino]); and the intention here is that this logical reasoning under the heading of deduction (^i[niddhāraṇa]) should be for the purpose of removing their doubts.
“Just as it is owing to full-understanding (reading ^i[yathā pariññeyyatāya]) that from the sense desires and from materiality, etc (reading ^i[rūpādīnaí]), that have something beyond them, there is made known an escape [from them] that is their opposite and whose individual essence is devoid of them, so there must exist an escape that is the opposite of, and whose individual essence is devoid of, all formed dhammas, all of which have the aforesaid individual essence (reading ^i[evaí taí-sabhāvānaí]), and it is this escape that is the unformed element.
“Besides, insight knowledge, which has formed dhammas as its object, and also conformity knowledge, abandon the defilements with the abandoning consisting in substitution of opposites, being unable to abandon them with the abandoning consisting in cutting off. Likewise, the kind of knowledge that has conventional truth (^i[sammuti-sacca]) [that is, concepts] as its object, in the first jhāna, etc., abandons the defilements only with the abandoning consisting in suppression, not by cutting them off. So, because the kind of knowledge that has formed dhammas as its object and that which has conventional truth as its object are both incapable of abandoning defilements by cutting them off, there must [consequently] exist an object for the noble-path- knowledge that effects their abandonment by cutting them off, [which object must be] of a kind opposite to both. And it is this that is the unformed element.
“Likewise, the words, ‘Bhikkhus, there is an unborn, an unbecome, an unmade, an unformed’ and so on, which demonstrate the existingness of Nibbāna in the ultimate sense, are not misleading because they are spoken by the Blessed One, like the words, ‘All formations are impermanent, all formations are painful, all ^i[dhammas] (states) are not self’ (Dhp 277–79; A I 286, etc.).
“Likewise, in certain instances as regards scope, the word ‘Nibbāna’ has the correct ultimate meaning for its scope [precisely] because of the existence of its use as a mere metaphor—like the word ‘lion’ (see Ch. XV, note 12, for the word lion). *Or alternatively, the unformed element exists in the ultimate sense also, because its individual essence is the opposite of, is free from, that of the other kind [of element such as] the earth element and feeling*” (Vism-mhṭ 534–40). The Pali of the last two paragraphs is taken to read thus:
“^i[Tathā ‘atthi bhikkhave ajātaí abhūtaí akataí asaṅkhatan’ ti idaí nibbāna-padassa paramatthato atthibhāva-jotakaí vacanaí aviparītatthaí bhagavatā kathitattā; yaí hi bhagavatā bhāsitaí taí aviparitatthaí yathā taí ‘sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā sabbe dhammā anattā’ ti].
^i[“Tathā nibbāna-saddo katthaci (pi) visaye yathābhūta-paramatthavisayo upacāravuttimatta-sabhāvato (pi) seyyathā pi sīha-saddo. *Atha vā atth’eva paramatthato asaṅkhata-dhātu itaraí tabbiparītavimutta-sabhāvattā seyyathā pi pathavī-dhātu vedanā vā ti.]”*
The discussion is summarized and additional arguments are added in the ^i[Abhidhammāvatāra]. The later ^i[Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha] appears to have shelved the problem. It may be noted that in the whole of this discussion (particularly in the answer to Q. 4) no mention is made of the abandoning of the inherent tendencies (^i[anusaya]) in the attainment of Nibbāna (see, e.g., MN 64; S II 66). For derivations of the word “Nibbāna” see VIII.247 and note 72.
^fn19 “Right speech has as its individual essence the embracing of associated states through affectionateness because it is the opposite of false speech and the other kinds, which, being rough owing to their respective functions of deceiving, etc., do not embrace” (Vism-mhṭ 541).
^fn20 “Bodily work (^i[kāyika-kriyā]) originates (sets up) whatever has to be done. And that originating (setting up) is itself a combining, so the abstinence called right action is said to have originating as its individual essence. Or it is the picking up of associated states which is the causing of them to be originated, on the part of bodily work, like the picking up of a burden” (Vism-mhṭ 541).
^fn21 “The purification of a living being or of associated states is ‘^i[cleansing]’” (Vism- mhṭ 541).
^fn22 ^i[Viniddhunana]—“shaking off”: not in PED, (but see under ^i[dhunāti]); cf. II.11.
^fn23 “Those who hold that there is an Overlord (Omnipotent Being) as reason say, ‘An Overlord (^i[issara]) makes the world occur, prepares it, halts, it, disposes of it.’ Those who hold that there is a Basic Principle as reason say, ‘The world is manifested from out of a Basic Principle (^i[padhāna]), and it is reabsorbed in that again.’ Those who hold the theory of Time say:
^stz Time it is that creates beings, Disposes of this generation; Time watches over those who sleep; To outstrip Time is hard indeed.
Those who hold the theory of Nature (^i[sabhāva]—individual essence) say, ‘The world appears and disappears (^i[sambhoti vibhoti ca]) just because of its nature (individual essence), like the sharp nature (essence) of thorns, like the roundness of wood-apples (^i[kabiṭṭha =Feronia elephantum]), like the variedness of wild beasts, birds, snakes, and so on.’ The word, ‘etc.’ refers to those who preach fatalism and say, ‘The occurrence of the world is due to atoms. All is due to causes effected in the past. The world is determined, like drilled gems threaded on an unbroken string. There is no doing by a man’; and to those who preach chance: It is by chance that they occur,
^stz By chance as well that they do not; Pleasure and pain are due to chance, This generation [lives] by chance; and to those who preach liberation by chance.
^i[“‘Taking final release to be in the immaterial world”] like that of Rāmudaka, Āḷāra (see MN 26), etc., or ‘^i[in a World Apex (World Shrine—lokathūpika])’ like that of the Nigaṇṭhas (Jains). And by the word, ‘etc.’ are included also the preachers of ‘Nibbāna here and now’ as the self’s establishment in its own self when it has become dissociated from the qualities (guṇa) owing to the non-occurrence of the Basic Principle (^i[padhāna], Skr. ^i[pradhāna]—see the Sāíkhya system), and being in the same world as, in the presence of, or in union with, Brahmā” (Vism-mhṭ 543).
^fn24 “The ‘^i[thirty-six modes of behaviour of craving]’ are the three, craving for sense desires, for becoming, and for non^i[-]becoming, in the cases of each one of the twelve internal-external bases; or they are those given in the Khuddakavatthu-Vibhaṅga (Vibh 391 and 396), leaving out the three periods of time, for with those they come to one hundred and eight” (Vism-mhṭ 544). “‘^i[Thoughts of renunciation, etc.]’: in the mundane moment they are the three separately, that is, non^i[-]greed, loving kindness, and compassion; they are given as one at the path moment, owing to the cutting off of greed, ill will and cruelty” (Vism-mhṭ 544).
“‘Consciousness concentration (^i[citta-samādhi])’ is the road to power consisting of [purity of] consciousness, they say” (Vism-mhṭ 544).
^fn25 It may be noted in passing that the word ^i[anattā](not-self) is never applied directly to Nibbāna in the Suttas (and Abhidhamma), or in Bhante Buddhaghosa’s commentaries (Cf. Ch. XXI, note 4, where Vism-mhṭ is quoted explaining the scope of applicability of the “three characteristics”). The argument introduced here that, since ^i[attā] (self) is a non^i[-] existent myth, therefore Nibbāna (the unformed dhamma, the truth of cessation) is ^i[void of self (atta-suñña]) is taken up in the ^i[Saddhammappakāsinī] (Hewavitarne Ce, p. 464):
^stz All dhammas whether grouped together In three ways, two ways, or one way, Are void: thus here in this dispensation Do those who know voidness make their comment.
“How so? Firstly, all mundane dhammas are void of lastingness, beauty, pleasure, and self because they are destitute of lastingness, beauty, pleasure, and self. Path and fruition dhammas are void of lastingness, pleasure, and self, because they are destitute of lastingness, pleasure, and self. Nibbāna dhammas (pl.) are void of self because of the non-existence (^i[abhāva]) of self. [Secondly,] formed dhammas, both mundane and supramundane, are all void of a [permanent] living being (^i[satta]) because of the non- existence of [such] a living being of any sort whatever. The unformed dhamma (sing.) is void of formations because of the non-existence (^i[abhāva:] or absence) of those formations too. [Thirdly,] all dhammas formed and unformed are void of self because of the non-existence of any person (^i[puggala]) called ‘self’ (^i[attā]).”
^fn26 “It is clung-to (^i[upādiyati]) by the kinds of clinging (^i[upādāna]), thus it is ‘result-of- past-clinging’ (^i[upādi]): this is the pentad of aggregates [as objects] of clinging. Taking Nibbāna, which is the escape from that, as its stilling, its quieting, since there is remainder of it up till the last consciousness [of the Arahant], after which there is no remainder of it, the Nibbāna element is thus conventionally spoken of in two ways as ‘with result of past clinging left’ (^i[sa-upādi-sesa]) and ‘without result of past clinging left’ (^i[an-upādi-sesa])” (Vism-mhṭ 547).

^c17
^fn1 “‘Subject to destruction’ (^i[khaya-dhamma]) means that its individual essence is the state of being destroyed (^i[khayana-sabhāva])” (Vism-mhṭ 549). The other expressions are explained in the same way.
^fn2 ^i[Paṭicco] as a declinable adjective is not in PED. ^i[Patīyamāna] (“when it is arrived at”): “When it is gone to by direct confrontation (^i[paṭimukhaí upeyamāno]) by means of knowledge’s going; when it is penetrated to (^i[abhisamiyamāna]), is the meaning” (Vism- mhṭ 555). The word ^i[paṭicca] (due to, depending on) and the word ^i[paccaya] (condition) are both gerunds of ^i[paṭi + eti] or
^i[ayati] (to go back to).
^fn3 “The doctrine of eternalism is that beginning ‘The world and self are eternal’” (D I 14). That of no-cause is that beginning, ‘There is no cause, there is no condition, for the defilement of beings’ (D I 53). That of fictitious-cause holds that the world’s occurrence is due to Primordial Essence (^i[prakṛti]), atoms (^i[aṇu]), time (^i[kāla]), and so on. That of a power-wielder asserts the existence of an Overlord (^i[issara]), or of a World-soul (^i[Puruṣa]), or of Pajāpati (the Lord of the Race). Also the doctrines of Nature (^i[sabhāva,] Skr. ^i[svabhāva] = individual essence), Fate (^i[niyati]), and Chance (^i[yadicchā]), should be regarded as included here under the doctrine of no-cause. Some, however, say that the doctrine of fictitious-cause is that beginning with ‘The eye is the cause of the eye,’ and that the doctrine of the power-wielder is that beginning, ‘Things occur owing to their own individual essence’ (see Ch. XVI, n. 23)” (Vism-mhṭ 557).
^fn4 “Such terms as ‘woman,’ ‘man,’ etc., are ^i[local forms of speech (janapada-nirutti]) because even wise men, instead of saying, ‘Fetch the five aggregates,’ or ‘Let the mentality-materiality come,’ use the current forms ‘woman’ and ‘man.’ This is how, in those who have not fully understood what a physical basis is, there comes to be the insistence (misinterpretation), ‘This is really a woman, this is really a man.’ But since this is a mere concept, which depends on states made to occur in such and such wise, one who sees and knows the dependent origination does not insist on (misinterpret) it as the ultimate meaning. ‘^i[Current speech]’ is speech current in the world. ‘^i[Not overriding]’ is not going beyond. For when ‘a being’ is said, instead of making an analysis like this, ‘What is the [lasting] being here? Is it materiality? Or feeling?’ and so on, one who does not override current usage should express a worldly meaning in ordinary language as those in the world do, employing the usage current in the world” (Vism-mhṭ 557– 58)^i[.] The explanation differs somewhat from MN 139.
^fn5 The term “analyzer” (^i[vibhajjavādin]) appears at A V 190, and at M II 197, in this sense, used to describe the Buddha and his followers, who do not rashly give unqualified answers to questions that need analyzing before being answered.
^fn6 “The ‘law’ (^i[dhamma]) is the text of the dependent origination. The “meaning” (^i[attha]) is the meaning of that. Or they are the cause, and the fruit of the cause here, is what is meant. Or “law” (^i[dhamma]) is regularity (^i[dhammatā]). Now some, misinterpreting the meaning of the sutta passage, ‘Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise, there yet remains that element …’ (S II 25), wrongly describe the regularity of the dependent origination as a ‘permanent dependent origination,’ instead of which it should be described as having the individual essence of a cause (^i[kāraṇa]), defined according to its own fruit, in the way stated. And some misinterpret the meaning of the dependent origination thus, ‘Without cessation, without arising’ (^i[anuppādaí anirodhaí]) instead of taking the unequivocal meaning in the way stated” (Vism-mhṭ 561). The last-mentioned quotation “Without cessation, without arising” (^i[anuppādaí anirodhaí]), seems almost certainly to refer to a well-known stanza in Nāgārjuna’s ^i[Mūlamādhyamika Kārikā]:
^i[Anirodhaí anutpādaí anucchedaí aśāsrataí Anekarthaí anānarthaí anāgamaí anirgamaí Yaḥ pratītyasamutpādaí prapañcopaśamaí śivaí Deśayamāsa sambuddhas taí vande vadatāí varaí].
^fn7 “Formations ‘^i[accumulate],’ work, for the purpose of rebirth. So that is their function. To accumulate is to heap up. Consciousness’s function is ‘^i[to go before]’ since it precedes mentality-materiality at rebirth-linking. Mentality’s function is ‘^i[to associate]’ since it joins with consciousness in a state of mutuality. ‘^i[Inseparability of its components]’ is owing to their having no separate existence [mentality here being feeling, perception, and formations]. Materiality is dispersible since it has in itself nothing [beyond the water element] to hold it [absolutely] together, so ‘^i[its function is to be dispersed]’; that is why, when rice grains, etc., are pounded, they get scattered and reduced to powder. It is called ‘^i[indeterminate]’ to distinguish it from mentality, which is profitable, etc., at different times” (Vism-mhṭ 571).
^fn8 “‘^i[No theory]’ is unknowing about suffering, etc., ‘^i[wrong theory]’ is perverted perception of what is foul, etc., as beautiful, etc., or else ‘^i[no theory]’ is unassociated with [false] view, and ‘^i[wrong theory]’ is associated with it” (Vism-mhṭ 751). This use of the word ^i[paṭipatti] as “theory,” rare in Pali but found in Sanskrit, is not in PED. An alternative rendering for these two terms might be “agnosticism” and “superstition” (see also XIV.163, 177).
^fn9 “‘^i[With the nature of result, and so on]’: the words ‘and so on’ here include ‘neither- trainer-nor-non-trainer,’ (Dhs 2) ‘conducive to fetters’ (Dhs 3), and so on. [§54] ‘^i[Mundane resultant and so on]’: the words ‘and so on’ here include ‘indeterminate’ (Dhs 2), ‘formed’ (Dhs 2), and so on. ‘^i[With root-cause and without root-cause, and so on]’: the words ‘and so on’ here include ‘prompted,’ ‘unprompted,’ and so on” (Vism-mhṭ).
^fn10 “This refers to the teacher Revata” (Vism-mhṭ 582).
^fn11 “‘^i[Which are contingent upon other such states]’: because it is said without distinction of all visible-data bases … and of all mental-data bases, there is consequently no dhamma (state) among the formed, unformed, and conceptual dhammas, classed as sixfold under visible data, etc., that does not become an object condition” (Vism-mhṭ 584).
^fn12 “Proximity and contiguity conditions are not stated in accordance with the distinction between making occur and giving opportunity, as the absence and disappearance conditions are: rather they are stated as the causes of the regular order of consciousness [in the cognitive series]” (Vism-mhṭ 585).
^fn13 “This refers to the Elder Revata too” (Vism-mhṭ 586).
^fn14 “The state ^i[of proximity condition]is the ability to cause arising proximately (without interval) because there is no interval between the cessation of the preceding and the arising of the subsequent. The state of ^i[contiguity condition] is the ability to cause arising by being quite proximate (without interval) through approaching, as it were, identity with itself owing to absence of any distinction that ‘This is below, above, or around that,’ which is because of lack of any such co-presence as in the case of the [components of the] material groups, and because of lack of any co-positionality of the condition and the conditionally arisen. And [in general], because of the uninterestedness of [all] states (^i[dhamma]), when a given [state] has ceased, or is present, in a given mode, and [other] states (^i[dhamma]) come to be possessed of that particular mode, it is that [state’s] mode that must be regarded as what is called ‘ability to cause arising’” (Vism-mhṭ 586).
^fn15 “Reviewing change-of-lineage” (the consciousness that precedes the path consciousness) applies to stream-enterers. “Reviewing cleansing” (the “cleansing” that consists in attaining a higher path than the first) applies to once-returners and non-returners (see Vism-mhṭ 589).
^fn16 “The presence (^i[atthi]) condition is not applicable to Nibbāna. For a presence condition is that which is unhelpful by its absence of existingness (^i[atthi-bhāvābhāva]) and becomes helpful by obtaining existingness. And Nibbāna does not, after being unhelpful by its own absence of existingness to those states that have Nibbāna as their object, become helpful to them by obtaining existingness. Or alternatively, the presence condition, which by its non-existingness is the opposite of helpfulness to those states that are associated with arising, etc., is helpful to them by its existingness. So Nibbāna is not a presence condition” (Vism-mhṭ 597).
It may be noted that ^i[atthi] has more than one use, among which the following two may be mentioned: (1) ^i[atthi] (is) = ^i[upalabbhaniya] (is (a) “apprehendable,” and (b) not a self-contradictory impossibility)—“^i[atthi, bhikkhave, ajātaí]—There is an unborn' (Ud 80), and the discussion on the existence of Nibbāna (XVI.67ff.). (2) ^i[Atthi] (is) = ^i[uppanna] (arisen)—see
^i[“Yaí, bhikkhave, rūpaí jātaí pātubhūtaí atthī ti tassa saṅkhā]—Of the materiality that is born, manifested, it is said that ‘It is’” (S II 71f.). The ^i[atthi-paccaya] (presence condition), being implicitly equated with the latter, cannot be applied to Nibbāna because Nibbāna is not subject to arising (A I 152).
^fn17  “The assertion of a single cause (^i[kāraṇa]) is undesirable because it follows that there would be production of everything all the time, and because it follows that there would be a single homogeneous state;” (Vism-mhṭ 599) cf. XIX.3.
^fn18 ^i[Parihāra-vacana]—“explanation”: not in PED in this sense.
^fn19 ^i[Avi]—“a goat or sheep”: not in PED. The Vism text reads “^i[golomāvilomavisāṇa- dadhitilapiṭṭhādīni ca dubbāsarabhūtanakādīnaí].” Vism-mhṭ explains thus: “^i[Golomāvilomādī ti ādisu golomāvilomāni dubbāya avī ti rattā eḷakā veditabbā visāṇaí sarassa dadhitilapiṭṭhagūlāni bhūtiṇakassa sevālaí taṇḍuleyyakassa kharavalavā assatarassā ti evam ādi ādisaddena saṅgahito],” which renders thus: “As to ‘^i[Ox hair and ram’s hair, etc.],’ and the rest: ox hair and ram’s hair [are conditions for the unlike] ^i[dubbā (dabba]) grass—a ram (^i[avi]) should be understood as a red sheep (^i[eḷakā]); horn is for reeds (^i[sara]); curds, sesame flour and molasses are for ^i[bhūtiṇaka] grass; moss is for the ^i[taṇḍuleyyaka] plant; a she donkey is for a mule; and so on in this way as included by the word ‘etc.’” (Vism-mhṭ 601). Except for the last-mentioned, it seems problematical why these things, if rightly interpreted, should be conditions for the things mentioned.
^fn20 For five-constituent becoming, etc., see §§253–54. “Unprofitable resultant eye- consciousness, etc. sometimes arise even in Brahmās when undesirable visible data, etc., come into focus” (Vism-mhṭ 604); cf. §180.
^fn21 This refers to the old Sinhalese commentary no longer extant.
^fn22 Vibh-a (Be) adds “^i[suddhāya va javanavīthiyā]” here, as in §140 below in all texts.
^fn23 “‘^i[With the appearance of fire and flames, etc., in the hells]’ is said owing to likeness to that; appearance of hell and fire does not itself come into focus for him then” (Vism-mhṭ 607).
^fn24 The ^i[Sammohavinodanī] adds more details here: “When hell appears it does so like a metal cauldron; when the human world appears, the mother’s womb appears like a woollen slipper (^i[kambala-yāna]—for ^i[yāna] as footwear or sandals see M-a III 222); when the heavenly world appears, wishing trees, divine palaces and couches, etc., appear.” Vism-mhṭ remarks here: “By the words ‘the appearance of the mother's womb,’ etc.,only visual appearanceis given as the sign of destiny. Herein, in the first place it would be logical that sound has not been given in the Commentaries as a sign of destiny because it is included in the happy destinies as not-clung-to, but the reason for odour, etc., not having been given, will be inquired into” (Vism-mhṭ 609). This question is in fact dealt with at length at Vism-mhṭ 611, but the arguments are not reproduced here. See note 26 below.
^fn25 ^i[Sa-bhāva] (with sex) and ^i[a-bhāva] (without sex) are not to be confused with ^i[sabhāva] (individual essence) and ^i[abhāva] (absence, non-existence).
^fn26 Vism-mhṭ (p. 611) has a long discussion here of the difficulty of speaking of the Brahmā-world (where there are only the senses of seeing and hearing) in terms of the decads, which contain the components of odour and flavour. (§156) It ends by defending the ^i[Visuddhimagga] standpoint.
^fn27 ^i[Sammohavinodanī](Be) has “rebirth-linking with a past, not so-classifiable, and present object next to” and so on.
^fn28 See the classification of kamma at XIX.74ff. “Repeated” (^i[samāsevita]) kamma is not mentioned there as such. Of “near” kamma Vism-mhṭ says, “It is that performed next to death, or which is conspicuous in the memory then, whenever it was performed” (Vism-mhṭ 617).
^fn29 “‘^i[Sign of the kamma]’ is the event (^i[vatthu]) by means of which a man accumulates kamma through making it the object at the time of accumulation. Even if the kamma was performed as much as a hundred thousand eons ago, nevertheless at the time of its ripening it appears as kamma or sign of kamma. The ‘^i[sign of the destiny]’ is one of the visual scenes in the place where rebirth is due to take place. It consists in the visual appearance of flames of fire, etc., to one ready to be reborn in hell, and so on as already stated” (Vism-mhṭ 617).
^fn30 “Owing to craving being unabandoned, and because the previously-arisen continuity is similarly deflected, consciousness occurs inclining, leaning and tending towards the place of rebirth-linking. The ‘^i[conascent formations]’ are the volitions conascent with the impulsion consciousness next to death. Or they are all those that begin with contact. They fling consciousness on to that place of rebirth-linking, which is the object of the kamma and so on. The meaning is that they occur as the cause for the establishment of consciousness on the object by rebirth-linking as though flinging it there” (Vism-mhṭ 617).
^fn31 “As a continuous process consisting of death, rebirth-linking, and the adjacent consciousnesses” (Vism-mhṭ 617).
^fn32 ^i[Paṭisiddhattā]—“because … excluded”: ^i[paṭisiddha] is not in PED. ^i[Abhisaṅkhāra] here might mean “planting work,” not “formative processes.”
^fn33 Vism-mhṭ points out that this is generally but not always so, since deities see such portents of their death as the fading of their flowers, etc., which are undesirable visible data (see note 43).
^fn34 A Sinhalese text adds the following paragraph: “Also the bodily formation, when giving rebirth-linking, gives the whole of its results in the sense-sphere becoming alone in the four generations, in the five destinies, in the first two stations of consciousness, and in two abodes of beings. Therefore it is a condition in the way already stated for the twenty-three kinds of consciousness in one kind of becoming, four generations, five destinies, two stations of consciousness, and two abodes of beings, both in rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence. The same method applies to the verbal formation. But the mental formation does not fail to ripen anywhere except in one abode of beings. Therefore it is a condition in the way already stated for the thirty-two kinds of resultant consciousness, as appropriate, in the three kinds of becoming, four generations, five destinies, seven stations of consciousness, and eight abodes of beings, both in rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence. There is no consciousness with formations as condition in the non-percipient abode of beings. Furthermore, in the case of non-percipient beings, the formation of merit is a condition, as kamma condition acting from a different time, for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed.”
^fn35 Resolve compound ^i[agahitagahaṇena] as ^i[gahitassa a-gahaṇena,] not as ^i[a-gahitassa gahaṇena;] i.e. it is “by not taking what is taken,” not “by taking what has not been taken”; cf. IV.75.
^fn36 “This means, due to the heat element in the materiality that arose together with the rebirth-linking consciousness. It is because the heart-basis is arisen only at that very moment, that there is weakness of the physical basis” (Vism-mhþ 622).
^fn37 ^i[Vāhanika]—“having a float”: not in PED. The context suggests a catamaran, universal in Indian waters.
^fn38 The expression “^i[ekadesasarūpekasesa]” is grammatically explained at Vism-mhṭ 623; see allied expressions, “^i[katekasesa]” (§204) and “^i[ekasese kate]” (§223). Cf. ^i[Pāṇini] I 2, 64.
^fn39 ^i[Rasāyana]—“elixir”: not in PED; cf. D-a 568 and Ud-a (commentary to Ud 8.5)
^fn40 “‘^i[Though feeling is condition]’ is said in order to prevent a generalization from the preceding words ‘With feeling as condition’ to the effect that craving arises in the presence of every condition accompanied by feeling—But is it not impossible to prevent over-generalization in the absence of any such statements as ‘Feeling accompanied by inherent tendency is a condition for craving’?—No; for we are dealing with an exposition of the round of rebirths. Since there is no round of rebirths without inherent tendencies, so far as the meaning is concerned it may be taken for granted that the condition is accompanied by inherent tendency. Or alternatively, it may be recognized that this condition is accompanied by inherent tendency because it follows upon the words ‘With ignorance as condition.’ And with the words ‘With feeling as condition, craving’ the ruling needed is this: ‘There is craving only with feeling as condition,’ and not ‘With feeling as condition there is only craving’” (Vism-mhṭ). For inherent tendencies see XXII.45, 60; MN 64. The Arahant has none.
^fn41 ^i[Upakuṭṭha]—“great pox” or “great leprosy”: not in PED; see ^i[kuṭṭha].
^fn42 Ee has “^i[sassatan ti]”; Ae has “^i[sā’ssa diṭṭhī ti]”; Vibh-a (Be), “^i[na sassatadiṭṭhī ti].”
^fn43 Their flowers wither, their clothes get dirty, sweat comes from their armpits, their bodies become unsightly, and they get restless (see M-a IV 170).
^fn44 As regards these four paragraphs from the Paṭisambhidā (see §§292, 294, 296, and 297), all four end with the word ‘^i[paccayā]’ (nom. pl. and abl. s. of ^i[paccaya] = condition). In the first and third paragraphs (§§292 and 296) this is obviously nom. pl. and agrees with ‘^i[ime pañca dhammā]’ (these five things). But in the second and fourth paragraphs the context suggests ^i[vipākā] (results) instead of conditions. However, there is no doubt that the accepted reading is ^i[paccayā] here too; for the passage is also quoted in XIX.13, in the ^i[Sammohavinodanī](Paccayākāra-Vibhaṅga commentary = present context), and at M-a I 53. The ^i[Paramatthamañjūsā] and ^i[Mūla ṭīkā] do not mention this point. The ^i[Saddhammappakāsinī] (Paṭisambhidā commentary) comments on the first paragraph: “^i[Purimakammabhavasmin ti atītajātiyā kammabhave karīyamāne pavattā; idha paṭisandhiyā paccayā ti paccuppannā paṭisandhiyā paccayabhūtā,”] and on the second paragraph: ^i[“Idh’upapattibhavasmií pure katassa kammassa paccayā ti paccuppanne vipākabhave atītajātiyaí katassa kammassa paccayena pavattī ti attho].” The ^i[Majjhima Nikāya ṭīkā] (M-a I 53) says of the second paragraph: “^i[Ime paccayā ti ime viññāṇādayo pañca koṭṭhāsikā dhammā, purimabhave katassa kammassa, kammavaṭṭassa, paccayā, paccayabhāvato, taí paṭicca, idha, etarahi, upapattibhavasmií upapattibhavabhāvena vā hontī ti attho.]” From these comments it is plain enough that “^i[paccayā]” in the second and fourth paragraphs is taken as abl. sing. (e.g. ^i[avijjā-paccayā saṅkhārā).] There is a parallel ablative construction with genitive at Paṭis II 72, 1.8: “^i[Gatisampattiyā ñāṇasampayutte aṭṭhannaí hetūnaí paccayā uppatti hoti].” Perhaps the literal rendering of the second and fourth paragraphs’ final sentence might be: “Thus there are these five things here in the [present] rebirth-process becoming with their condition [consisting] of kamma done in the past,” and so on. The point is unimportant.
^fn45 “Sorrow, etc., have already been established as ignorance; but death consciousness itself is devoid of ignorance and formations and is not a condition for the next becoming; that is why ‘^i[because it assures sorrow, etc.]’ is said” (Vism-mhṭ 640).
^fn46 ^i[Avatthā]—“occasion”: not in PED.
^fn47 ^i[Avyāpāra]—“uninterest”: here the equivalent of ^i[anābhoga,] see IV.171 and IX.108. The perhaps unorthodox form “uninterest” has been used to avoid the “unselfish” sense sometimes implied by “disinterestedness.”^i[Vyāpāra] is clearly intended throughout this work as “motivated action” in contrast with “blind action of natural forces.” The word “interest” has therefore been chosen to bring out this effect.
^fn48 The dependent origination, or structure of conditions, appears as a flexible formula with the intention of describing the ordinary human situation of a man in his world (or indeed any conscious event where ignorance and craving have not entirely ceased). That situation is always complex, since it is implicit that consciousness with no object, or being (^i[bhava]—becoming, or however rendered) without consciousness (of it), is impossible except as an artificial abstraction. The dependent origination, being designed to portray the essentials of that situation in the limited dimensions of words and using only elements recognizable in experience, is not a logical proposition (Descartes’ ^i[cogito] is not a logical proposition). Nor is it a temporal cause-and-effect chain: each member has to be examined as to its nature in order to determine what its relations to the others are (e.g. whether successive in time or conascent, positive or negative, etc., etc.). A purely cause-and-effect chain would not represent the pattern of a situation that is always complex, always subjective-objective, static-dynamic, positive-negative, and so on. Again, there is no evidence of any historical development in the various forms given ^i[within the limit of the Sutta Piṭaka] (leaving aside the Paṭisambhidāmagga), and historical treatment within that particular limit is likely to mislead, if it is hypothesis with no foundation.
Parallels with European thought have been avoided in this translation. But perhaps an exception can be made here, with due caution, in the case of Descartes. The revolution in European thought started by his formula ^i[cogito ergo sum] (“I think, therefore I am”) is not yet ended. Now, it will perhaps not escape notice that the two elements, “I think” and “I am,” in what is not a logical proposition parallel to some extent the two members of the dependent origination, consciousness and being (becoming). In other words, consciousness activated by craving and clinging as the dynamic factory, guided and blinkered by ignorance (“I think” or “consciousness with the conceit ‘I am’”), conditions being (“therefore I am”) in a complex relationship with other factors relating subject and object (not accounted for by Descartes). The parallel should not be pushed too far. In fact it is only introduced because in Europe the dependent origination seems to be very largely misunderstood with many strange interpretations placed upon it, and because the ^i[cogito] does seem to offer some sort of reasonable approach. In this work, for convenience because of the special importance attached here to the aspect of the death-rebirth link, the dependent origination is considered from only one standpoint, namely, as applicable to a period embracing a minimum of three lives. But this is not the only application. With suitable modifications it is also used in the Vibhaṅga to describe the structure of the complex in each one of the 89 single type- consciousnesses laid down in the ^i[Dhammasaṅgaṇī]; and Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa says: “This structure of conditions is present not only in (a continuity period consisting of) multiple consciousnesses but also in each single consciousness as well” (Vibh-a 199–200). Also the Paṭisambhidāmagga gives five expositions, four describing dependent origination in one life, the fifth being made to present a special inductive generalization to extend what is observable in this life (the fact that consciousness is always preceded by consciousness, cf. this Ch. §83f.—i.e. that it always has a past and is inconceivable without one) back beyond birth, and (since craving and ignorance ensure its expected continuance) on after death. There are, besides, various other, differing applications indicated by the variant forms given in the suttas themselves.

^fn1 “Mentality should be taken here as the four aggregates beginning with feeling and belonging to the three planes, not omitting consciousness as in the case of ‘With consciousness as condition, mentality-materiality’ and not including the supramundane aggregates associated with Nibbāna” (Vism-mhṭ 744 (Be)).
^fn2 Serenity (^i[samatha]) is a general term for concentration, as the complement of insight (^i[vipassanā]), which is roughly the equivalent of understanding (^i[paññā]).
^fn3 “One who is beginning this work has difficulty in discerning the highest form of becoming, that is, the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception” (Vism- mhṭ 744). This is owing to the diminished perception (see M III 28).
^fn4 See S II 23f. “Bending in the direction of the object means that there is no occurrence without an object; it is in the sense of that sort of bending, or it is in the sense of bestowing a name (^i[nāma-karaṇa])” (Vism-mhṭ 744). “Name-and-form” has many advantages over “mentality-materiality” if only because it preserves the integrity of ^i[nāma] and excludes any metaphysical assumption of matter existing as a substance behind apparent forms.
^fn5 “Because sweat, etc., arise owing to heat, fatigue, etc., and owing to mental perturbation, they are called ‘originated by temperature and by consciousness’” (Vism- mhṭ 745). There are seven kinds of decads: those of the physical basis of mind (heart), sex, living, physical eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. The first nine components of a decad are the same in all instances, and by themselves they are called the “life ennead.” The first eight components by themselves are called the “octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth.” This octad plus sound is called the “sound ennead.” In general these are called “material groups” (^i[rūpa-kalāpa]). But this kind of group (^i[kalāpa]) has nothing to do with the “comprehension by groups” (^i[kalāpa-sammasana]) of Ch. XX, which is simply generalization (from one’s own particular experience to each of the five aggregates as past, etc., i.e. as a “group”). The “material groups” are not in the Piṭakas.
^fn6 The ten are four aspects of the fire element and six aspects of the air element; what heats, what consumes, what burns up, what digests; up-going winds (or forces), down-going winds, winds in the stomach, winds in the bowels, winds in the limbs, breath. See XI.37, 82.
^fn7 “The exalted consciousness of the fine-material and immaterial spheres is only quite plain to one who has attained the attainments” (Vism-mhṭ 746).
^fn8 “As well as by means of the elements, etc., materiality can also be discerned through the faculties, the truths, and the dependent origination. How?
“Firstly, through the faculties. These seven, namely, the five beginning with the eye plus femininity and masculinity are materiality; the eleven consisting of the mind faculty, the five feeling faculties, and the five beginning with faith, are mentality; the life faculty is both mentality and materiality. The last three, being supramundane, are not intended here. The truth of suffering is both mentality and materiality; the truth of origin is mentality; the other two are not intended here because they are supramundane. “In the structure of conditions, the first three members are mentality; the fourth and fifth are mentality and materiality; the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth are mentality; the tenth is both mentality and materiality; the last two are each mentality and materiality” (Vism-mhṭ 747f.).
^fn9 “‘^i[All states of the three planes]’ is said all-inclusively owing to the necessity not to omit anything suitable for comprehension. For it must be fully understood without any exception, and greed must be made to fade away absolutely so that the mind may be liberated by the fading away of greed. That is why the Blessed One said: ‘Bhikkhus, without directly knowing, without fully understanding all, without causing the fading away of greed for it, without abandoning it, the mind is incapable of the destruction of suffering. Bhikkhus, it is by directly knowing, by fully understanding all, by causing the fading away of greed for it, by abandoning it, that the mind is capable of the destruction of suffering’ (S IV 17). If all the states of the three planes are taken as mentality-materiality without exception, then how should one deal with what has been conceived by those outside the Dispensation as verbal meanings, such as the Primordial Essence (^i[pakati]), etc. [e.g. of the Sāíkhya], the substance (^i[drabya]), etc. [e.g. of the Vaiśeṣika], the soul (^i[jīva]), etc., and the body (^i[kāya]), etc. [?] Since these are like the hallucination of lunatics and are taught by the not fully enlightened, what other way of dealing with them is there than to ignore them? Or alternatively, their existence or non-existence can be understood as established by their inclusion within mentality- materiality” (Vism-mhṭ 751f.). There follows a long paragraph showing how the concepts of these systems are to be assimilated into mentality-materiality whereby they lose their significance and are shown to be impermanent and formed. Vism-mhṭ concludes by saying, “Wherever the verbal meaning of self is expressed by some such metaphor as world-soul (^i[purisa]), self (^i[attā, ātman]), soul (^i[jīva]), etc., these being themselves conceived in their various ways on the basis of mere mentality-materiality, are mere mentality-materiality, too” (Vism-mhṭ 754f.).
^c19
^fn1 “If the fruit were to arise from present kamma, the fruit would have arisen in the same moment in which the kamma was being accumulated; and that is not seen, nor is it desirable. For in the world (i.e. among non-Buddhists) kamma has never been shown to give fruit while it is actually being effected; nor is there any text to that effect—But is it not also the fact that no fruit has ever been shown to come from a vanished cause either? Or even a cock to crow because of that?—Certainly it has not been shown where the connectedness of material things is broken off. But the simile does not apply because there is connectedness of immaterial things here. For when the fruit arises from kamma that is actually past it does so because of kamma having been performed and because of storage. For this is said: ‘Because profitable sense- sphere kamma has been performed, stored up, there comes to be eye-consciousness’ (Dhs §431).
“Since consciousness has efficient power only at the instant of its arising, with the acquisition of a proximity condition, etc., it therefore only gives rise to materiality while it is arising. But since materiality has efficient power at the instant of its presence, with the acquisition of a postnascence condition, etc., it is therefore said that ‘temperature and nutriment are conditions at the instant of their presence fortemperature-originated and nutriment-originated materiality.’ Temperature and nutriment give rise to materiality at the instant of their own presence by acquiring outside temperature and nutriment as their condition, is the meaning” (Vism-mhṭ 768).
^fn2 “To be experienced here and now” means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced in this present selfhood. “To be experienced on rebirth” means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced [in the becoming] next to the present becoming. “To be experienced in some subsequent existence” means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced in some successive selfhood other than either that here and now or next to that here and now. “Lapsed kamma” is kamma of which it has to be said, “There has been kamma, but there has not been, is not, and will not be kamma-result.”
“The volition of the first impulsion, which has efficient power by not being prevented by opposition and by having acquired the distinction of a condition, and which has definitely occurred as a prior kamma-formation of the appropriate kind, giving its fruit in this same selfhood, is called ‘^i[to be experienced here and now.]’ For while that first- impulsion volition, being effective in the way stated, is helpful to what is associated with its special qualities in the impulsion continuity, yet because it wields little power over aspects and because it has little result owing to lack of repetition, it is not, like the other two kinds, kamma that looks beyond the occurring continuity and looks to obtain an opportunity; it gives its fruit here only as mere result during the course of becoming, like a mere flower. ‘^i[But if it cannot do so]’: kamma’s giving of result comes about only through the due concurrence of conditions consisting of (suitable) essentials of becoming, means, etc., failing which it is unable to give its result in that selfhood. ‘^i[That accomplishes its purpose]’: that fulfils its purpose consisting in giving, etc., and in killing, etc. For the seventh impulsion to which this refers is the final impulsion in the series, and when it has acquired distinction in the way already stated and has acquired the service of repetition by the previous impulsions, it gives its result in the next selfhood and is called ‘to be experienced on rebirth‘” (Vism-mhṭ 769).
^fn3 “‘Weighty’ kamma is very reprehensible unprofitable kamma and very powerful profitable kamma. ‘Habitual’ kamma is what is habitually, continually done and repeated. ‘Death-threshold’ kamma is what is remembered with great vividness at the time next before death; what is meant is that there is no question about what is done at the time of death. ‘That has been often repeated’: he draws a distinction between this kind of kamma as stated and the ‘habitual’ kind and he likewise excludes kamma to be experienced here and now from it because the bringing on of rebirth-linking is admitted; for the tetrad beginning with the ‘weighty’ is stated as productive of rebirth-linking.
“Herein, the weighty ripens first of all and that is why it is so called. When weighty kamma is lacking, what has been much done ripens. When that is lacking, death-threshold kamma ripens. When that too is lacking, then kamma done in previous births, which is called ‘kamma [stored up] by being performed,’ ripens. And the last three when produced can be strong or weak” (Vism-mhṭ 769ff.). Vism-mhṭ then cites various Birth Stories and MN 136 in order to show how, for various reasons, the result of one kind of kamma may be delayed or displaced by the result of another. Vism-mhṭ concludes: “This is the province of the Tathāgata’s Knowledge of the Great Exposition of Kamma, in other words, the mastery of the order of ripening of such and such kamma for such and such reasons.”
^fn4 “‘Productive’ kamma is what produces resultant continuity by providing rebirth- linking and so on. ‘Consolidating’ kamma prolongs the occurrence of the continuity of pleasure or pain, or the endurance of materiality. ‘Frustrating’ kamma slowly diminishes the endurance of pleasure or pain when they occur. It cuts off the result of other kamma without giving any result of its own. ‘Supplanting’ kamma, however, cuts off weak kamma and makes its own result arise. This is their difference” (Vism-mhṭ 771).
^fn5 See the various meanings of “arisen” given in XXII.81f.
“Another method is this: when some kamma has been done and there is, either in rebirth-linking or in the course of an existence, the arising of material instances due to the result of kamma performed, that kamma is ‘^i[productive].’ When some kamma has been performed and the desirable or undesirable fruit generated by other kamma has its production facilitated and its endurance aided and lengthened by the suppression of conditions that would interfere with it and by the arousing of conditions that would strengthen it, that kamma is ‘^i[supporting].’ When some kamma has been performed and profitable fruit or unprofitable fruit generated by productive kamma is obstructed by it respectively in the form of sickness or of disquieting of elements, that is ‘^i[frustrating]’ kamma. But when some kamma has been done by which the fruit of other kamma is ruined and cut off by being supplanted by what cuts it off although it was fit for longer endurance because of the efficacy of the kamma that was producing it, that kamma is ‘^i[supplanting]’” (Vism-mhṭ 772).
^fn6 “Because it is a speciality of the Buddha and because it is the province of the knowledge that is not shared by disciples (see Paṭis I 121f.), it is called ‘not shared by disciples.’ That is why only a part can be known; it cannot all be known because it is not the province of such knowledge” (Vism-mhṭ 772).
^c20
^fn1 “Comprehension by placing together in groups (totals) the states that are differentiated into past, future and present is ‘^i[comprehension by groups].’ This, it seems, is the term used by the inhabitants of Jambudīpa (India). However, insight into states by means of the method beginning, ‘Any materiality whatever’ (M III 16) is ‘^i[inductive insight].’ This, it seems, is the term used by the inhabitants of Tambapaṇṇidīpa (Sri Lanka). That is why he said “^i[to inductive insight called comprehension by groups]’” (Vism-mhṭ 778).
^fn2 ^i[Tīraṇa] could also be rendered by “judging.” On specific and general characteristics Vism-mhṭ says: “Hardness, touching, etc., as the respective characteristics of earth, contact, etc., which are observable at all three instants [of arising, presence and dissolution], are apprehended by their being established as the respective individual essences of definite materialness. But it is not so with the characteristics of impermanence, and so on. These are apprehended as though they were attributive material instances because they have to be apprehended under the respective headings of dissolution and rise and fall, of oppression, and of insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery” (Vism-mhṭ 779). See Ch. XXI, note 3.
The “planes” given here in §4 are not quite the same as described in XXII.107.
^fn3 “‘^i[Contemplating as impermanent]’ is contemplating, comprehending, formations in the aspect of impermanence. ‘^i[The perception of permanence]’ is the wrong perception that they are permanent, eternal; the kinds of consciousness associated with wrong view should be regarded as included under the heading of ‘perception.’ So too with what follows. ‘^i[Becoming dispassionate]’ is seeing formations with dispassion by means of the contemplation of dispassion induced by the contemplations of impermanence, and so on. ‘^i[Delighting]’ is craving accompanied by happiness. ‘Causing fading away’ is contemplating in such a way that greed (^i[rāga]) for formations does not arise owing to the causing of greed to fade (^i[virajjana]) by the contemplation of fading away (^i[virāgānupassanā]); for one who acts thus is said to abandon greed. ‘^i[Causing cessation]’ is contemplating in such a way that, by the contemplation of cessation, formations cease only, they do not arise in the future through a new becoming; since one who acts thus is said to abandon the arousing (originating) of formations because of producing the nature of non-arising. ‘^i[Relinquishing]’ is relinquishing in such a way that, by the contemplation of relinquishment, formations are not grasped anymore; hence he said, ‘^i[He abandons grasping]’; or the meaning is that he relinquishes apprehending [them] as permanent, and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 780).
^fn4 “‘^i[Liking that is in conformity]’ is a liking for knowledge that is in conformity with the attainment of the path. Actually the knowledge itself is the ‘liking’ (^i[khanti]) since it likes (^i[khamati]), it endures, defining by going into the individual essence of its objective field. The ‘^i[certainty of rightness]’ is the noble path; for that is called the rightness beginning with right view and also the certainty of an irreversible trend” (Vism-mhṭ 784).

He said ‘^i[and basing itself on that]’ meaning that its obtaining of a condition is owing to its being supported by what is kamma-born. And ‘^i[clung-to]’ is specifically mentioned in order to rule out any question of there being a ‘kamma- born’ method for ‘materiality originated by consciousness that has kamma as its condition’ just because it happens to be rooted in kamma [There is no such method]” (Vism-mhṭ 793f.).

So too the apprehending of generation in the other instances” (Vism-mhṭ 795).

^fn20 “No one, not even the Blessed One, has such mastery; for it is impossible for anyone to alter the three characteristics. The province of supernormal power is simply the alteration of a state” (Vism-mhṭ 797).
“‘^i[Because of precluding a self]’ means because of precluding the self conceived by those outside the Dispensation; for the non-existence in dhammas of any self as conceived by outsiders is stated by the words, ‘^i[because void]’; but by this expression [it is stated] that there is no self because there is no such individual essence” (Vism-mhṭ 797).

^fn23 This verse is quoted twice in the Mahāniddesa (Nidd I 42 &amp; 118). For Vism-mhṭ’s comment see Ch. VIII, note 11. Vism-mhṭ and the Sinhalese translation have been taken as guides in rendering this rather difficult verse. There is another stanza in the Niddesa not quoted here:
^stz “… this concept will allow. States happen as their tendencies dictate; And they are modelled by desire; their stream Uninterruptedly flows ever on Conditioned by the sixfold base of contact. No store of broken states …”
^fn24 The “contact pentad” (^i[phassa-pañcamaka]) is a term used for the first five things listed in Dhs §1, that is, contact, feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness, which are invariably present whenever there is consciousness.
^fn25 The “Discourse on Purification” (^i[visuddhi-kathā]) and the “Discourse on the Noble Ones’ Heritages” (^i[ariyavaísa-kathā]) are presumably names of chapters in the old Sinhalese commentaries no longer extant.
^fn26 “Said in the Discourse on the Noble Ones’ Heritages” (Vism-mhṭ 804).
^fn27 The first seven of the eighteen principal insights are known as the “seven contemplations”; see 20.4. Further descriptions are given in XXII.113f.
^fn28 For Vism-mhṭ’s comments on the first seven see note 3 to this chapter. ‘^i[Contemplation of destruction]’ is the contemplation of the momentary dissolution of formations. ‘^i[Perception of compactness]’ is the assumption of unity in a continuity or mass or function or object. ‘^i[Contemplation of destruction]’ is contemplation of non- existence after having been, they say. Contemplation of destruction is the understanding by means of which he resolves the compact into its elements and sees that it is impermanent in the sense of destruction. Its completion starts with contemplation of dissolution, and so there is abandoning of perception of compactness then, but before that there is not, because it has not been completed. (9) The seeing of the dissolution of formations both by actual experience and by inference and the directing of attention to their cessation, in other words, their dissolution, is ^i[contemplation of fall]; through it accumulation [of kamma] is abandoned; his consciousness does not incline with craving to the occurrence of that [aggregate-process of existence] for the purpose of which one accumulates [kamma]. (10) Seeing change in the two ways through aging and through death in what is born, or seeing another essence subsequent to the delimitation of such and such [an essence supervening] in what was discerned by means of the material septad, and so on, is ‘^i[contemplation of change]’; by its means he abandons the ‘^i[perception of lastingness],’ the assumption of stability. (11)–(13) The three beginning with ‘^i[contemplation of the signless]’ are the same as the three beginning with contemplation of impermanence. (11) ‘^i[The sign]’ is the mere appearance of formations as if graspable entities, which is due to the individualization of particular functions and which, owing to perception of unity in continuity and in mass, is assumed to be temporarily enduring or permanent. (12) ‘^i[Desire]’ is longing for pleasure, or it is desire consisting in greed, and so on; it means inclinationto formations owing to craving. (13) ‘^i[Misinterpreting]’ is misinterpreting as self. It is owing to their opposing the ‘^i[sign],’ etc., that the contemplations of impermanence, etc., are called by the names of ‘signless,’ etc.; so they should be regarded as opposed to the apprehension of a sign, etc., just as they are to the perception of permanence, and so on. (14) Insight that occurs by knowing an object consisting of a visible datum, etc., and by seeing the dissolution of the consciousness that had that visible datum, etc., as its object, and by apprehending voidness through the dissolution thus, ‘Only formations dissolve, there is nothing beyond the death of formations,’ is the higher understanding, and that is insight into states, thus it is ‘^i[insight into states that is higher understanding]’; by its means he abandons the view accompanied by craving that is the misinterpretation occurring as grasping at a permanent core, and so on. (15) ‘^i[Correct knowledge and vision]’ is a term for the seeing of mentality-materiality with its conditions; by its means he abandons the ‘^i[misinterpreting due to confusion]’ that begins thus, ‘Was I in the past?’ (M I 8) and that begins thus, ‘Thus the world is created by an Overlord’ (?). (16) The knowledge consisting in the seeing of danger in all kinds of becomings, etc., which has arisen owing to the appearance of terror is ‘^i[contemplation of danger]’; by its means he abandons the craving occurring as ‘^i[misinterpreting due to reliance]’ because he does not see any reliance or support. (17) The knowledge of reflection that is the means to deliverance from formations is ‘^i[contemplation of reflection]’; by its means he abandons the ignorance that is ‘^i[non-reflection]’ on impermanence, etc., and is opposed to reflection on them. (18) Equanimity about formations and conformity knowledge are ‘^i[contemplation of turning away]’; for owing to it the mind retreats and recoils from all formations, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, so by its means he abandons the ‘^i[misinterpretation due to bondage],’ which is the occurrence of the defilements consisting of the fetters of sense desire, and so on. (Vism-mh 806f.)
^fn29 See XXII.113f. “When (1) the contemplation of impermanence is established, then the contemplations of (6) cessation, (8) destruction, (9) fall, and (10) change are partly established. When (2) the contemplation of pain is established, then the contemplations of (4) dispassion and (16) danger are partly established. And when (3) the contemplation of not-self is established, then the rest are partly established” (Vism-mhṭ 807).
^fn30 “The interpreting of rise and fall must be done on a state that is present according to continuity or present according to instant but not on one that is past or future, which is why ‘of present states’ is said” (Vism-mhṭ 808). “Present materiality is called born materiality; it is included in the trio of instants [of arising, presence and dissolution], is what is meant. But that is hard to discern at the start, so the interpreting by insight should be done by means of presence according to continuity” (Vism-mhṭ 808). For the elision represented by “… (etc.) …” see XX.9. In this case, however, the last two members of the dependent origination are left out. “Although states possessed of aging-and-death are mentioned under the heading of birth and of aging- and-death in comprehension by groups, etc., nevertheless here in the description of knowledge of rise and fall, if it were said ‘present birth is born; the characteristic of its generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall,’ etc., it would be tantamount to an affirmation and approval of the proposition that birth and aging-and-death were possessed of birth and of aging-and-death. So the text ends with ‘becoming’ in order to avoid that” (Vism-mhṭ 808).
^fn31 “With the seeing of rise and fall not only the characteristics of impermanence and pain become evident, but also the characteristics, in other words, the individual essences, of earth, contact, etc., termed hardness, touching, etc., respectively, become clearly evident and discrete (^i[avacchinna]) in their individual essences” (Vism-mhṭ 814).
^fn32 “The inclusion of only rise and fall here is because this kind of knowledge occurs as seeing only rise and fall, not because of non-existence of the instant of presence” (Vism-mhṭ 814). See Introduction, note 18.
^fn33 “He adverts to it as Nibbāna or as the path or as fruition” (Vism-mhṭ 816). “The agitation, the distraction, that occurs about whether or not the illumination, etc., are noble states is ‘^i[agitation about higher states’]” (Vism-mhṭ 815). In this connection Vism- mhṭ quotes the following text: “Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who declares the attainment of Arahantship in my presence has always arrived there by four paths or by one of them. What four? Here, friends, a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by serenity. While he is developing insight preceded by serenity the path is born in him. He cultivates, develops, repeats that path. As he does so his fetters are abandoned and his inherent tendencies are brought to an end. Again, friends, a bhikkhu develops serenity preceded by insight … He develops serenity and insight yoked equally. Again, friends, a bhikkhu’s mind is seized by agitation about highest states. When that consciousness settles down internally, becomes steady, unified and concentrated, then the path is born in him … his inherent tendencies are brought to an end” (A II 157).
^fn34 “‘^i[Illumination due to insight]’ is the luminous materiality originated by insight consciousness, and that originated by temperature belonging to his own continuity. Of these, that originated by insight consciousness is bright and is found only in the meditator’s body. The other kind is independent of his body and spreads all round over what is capable of being experienced by knowledge. It becomes manifest to him too, and he sees anythingmaterial in the place touched by it” (Vism-mhṭ 816).
^fn35 ^i[Caturaṅga-samannāgataí tamaí]—“four-factored gloom” is mentioned also at S-a I 170, M-a V 16 (c. ^i[andhakāra]), and Ud-a 66, 304.
^fn36 ^i[Okkhandati]—“to descend into”: not in PED; see XXII.34 and M-a I 238.
^fn37 “‘^i[Equanimity about insight]’ is neutrality in the investigation of formations owing to the objective field having been already investigated. But in meaning, when it occurs thus, it is only neutrality. The volition associated with mind-door adverting is called ‘^i[equanimity (upekkhā) in adverting]’ because it occurs in adverting as onlooking (^i[ajjhupekkhana])” (Vism- mhṭ 819).
^fn38 Be Vism-mhṭ reads “^i[ayaí kho so]” instead of the “^i[ayaí kho me]” in the Ee and Ae editions.

^fn1 “He calls conformity knowledge ‘^i[knowledge in conformity with truth]’ because it is suitable for penetrating the truths owing to the disappearance of the grosser darkness of delusion that conceals the truths” (Vism-mhṭ 822). The term ^i[saccānulomikañāṇa]—“knowledge in conformity with truth,” occurs at Vibh 315. The term ^i[anulomañāṇa]—“conformity knowledge,” occurs in the Paṭṭhāna (Paṭṭh I 159), but not elsewhere in the Piṭakas apparently.
^fn2 “^i[Knowledge of rise and fall] that has become familiar should be understood as belonging to full-understanding as abandoning. The contemplation of only the dissolution of formations is contemplation of dissolution; that same contemplation as knowledge is ^i[knowledge of contemplation of dissolution]. One who, owing to it, sees things as they are is terrified, thus it is terror. The knowledge that seizes the terrifying aspect of states of the three planes when they appear as terrifying is ^i[knowledge of appearance as terror]. One desires to be delivered, thus it is one desiring deliverance: that is, either as a consciousness or as a person. His (its) state is desire for deliverance. That itself as ^i[knowledge is knowledge of desire for deliverance]. Knowledge that occurs in the mode of reflecting again is ^i[knowledge of contemplation of reflection]. Knowledge that occurs as looking on (^i[upekkhanā]) at formations with indifference (^i[nirapekkhatā]) is knowledge of equanimity (^i[upekkhā]) about formations” (Vism-mhṭ 822–23).
^fn3 Cf. Peṭ 128. In the commentary to the Āyatana-Vibhaṅga we find: “Impermanence is obvious, as when a saucer (say) falls and breaks; … pain is obvious, as when a boil (say) appears in the body; … the characteristic of not-self is not obvious; … Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise the characteristics of impermanence and pain are made known, but unless there is the arising of a Buddha the characteristic of not-self is not made known” (Vibh-a 49–50, abridged for clarity).
Again, in the commentary to Majjhima Nikāya Sutta 22: “Having been, it is not, therefore it is impermanent; it is impermanent for four reasons, that is, in the sense of the state of rise and fall, of change, of temporariness, and of denying permanence. It is painful on account of the mode of oppression; it is painful for four reasons, that is, in the sense of burning, of being hard to bear, of being the basis for pain, and of opposing pleasure … It is not-self on account of the mode of insusceptibility to the exercise of power; it is not-self for four reasons, that is, in the sense of voidness, of having no owner-master, of having no Overlord, and of opposing self (M-a II 113, abridged for clarity).
Commenting on this Vism paragraph, Vism-mhṭ says: “‘^i[When continuity is disrupted]’ means when continuity is exposed by observing the perpetual otherness of states as they go on occurring in succession. For it is not through the connectedness of states that the characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent to one who rightly observes rise and fall, but rather the characteristic becomes more thoroughly evident through their disconnectedness, as if they were iron darts. ‘^i[When the postures are exposed]’ means when the concealment of the pain that is actually inherent in the postures is exposed. For when pain arises in a posture, the next posture adopted removes the pain, as it were, concealing it. But once it is correctly known how the pain in any posture is shifted by substituting another posture for that one, then the concealment of the pain that is in them is exposed because it has become evident that formations are being incessantly overwhelmed by pain. ‘^i[Resolution of the compact]’ is effected by resolving [what appears compact] in this way, ‘The earth element is one, the water element is another’ etc., distinguishing each one; and in this way, ‘Contact is one, feeling is another’ etc., distinguishing each one. ‘^i[When the resolution of the compact is effected]’ means that what is compact as a mass and what is compact as a function or as an object has been analyzed. For when material and immaterial states have arisen mutually steadying each other, [mentality and materiality, for example,] then, owing to misinterpreting that as a unity, compactness of mass is assumed through failure to subject formations to pressure. And likewise compactness of function is assumed when, although definite differences exist in such and such states’ functions, they are taken as one. And likewise compactness of object is assumed when, although differences exist in the ways in which states that take objects make them their objects, those objects are taken as one. But when they are seen after resolving them by means of knowledge into these elements, they disintegrate like froth subjected to compression by the hand. They are mere states (^i[dhamma]) occurring due to conditions and void. In this way the characteristic of not-self becomes more evident” (Vism-mhṭ 824).
^fn4 “These modes, [that is, the three characteristics,] are not included in the aggregates because they are states without individual essence (^i[asabhāva-dhammā]); and they are not separate from the aggregates because they are unapprehendable without the aggregates. But they should be understood as appropriate conceptual differences (^i[paññatti-visesā]) that are reason for differentiation in the explaining of dangers in the five aggregates, and which are allowable by common usage in respect of the five aggregates” (Vism-mhṭ 825).
^fn5 “The keenness of knowledge comes about owing to familiarity with development. And when it is familiar, development occurs as though it were absorbed in the object owing to the absence of distraction” (Vism-mhṭ 825).
^fn6 “‘^i[Arising]’ is the alteration consisting in generation. ‘^i[Presence]’ is the arrival at presence: ageing is what is meant. ‘^i[Occurrence]’ is the occurrence of what is clung to. ‘^i[The sign]’ is the sign of formations; the appearance of formations like graspable entities, which is due to compactness of mass, etc., and to individualization of function, is the sign of formations” (Vism-mhṭ 826). See also n.12.
“It is momentary cessation that is in other words ‘^i[cessation as destruction, fall and breakup]’” (Vism-mhṭ 826).
^fn7 ^i[Etasmií khaṇe] (or ^i[etasmií ṭhāne]) seems a better reading here than ^i[ekasmií khaṇe]’; cf. parallel phrases at the end of §29, 30, 31.
^fn8 “‘He contemplates as impermanent’ here not by inferential knowledge thus, “Impermanent in the sense of dissolution”, like one who is comprehending formations by groups (XX.13–14), nor by seeing fall preceded by apprehension of rise, like a beginner of insight (XX.93ff.); but rather it is after rise and fall have become apparent as actual experience through the influence of knowledge of rise and fall that he then leaves rise aside in the way stated and contemplates formations as impermanent by seeing only their dissolution. But when he sees them thus, there is no trace in him of any apprehension of them as permanent” (Vism-mhṭ 827).
^fn9 “‘^i[Causes cessation]’: he causes greed to reach the cessation of suppression; he suppresses it, is the meaning. That is why he said ‘^i[by means of mundane knowledge].’ And since there is suppression, how can there be arousing? Therefore he said ‘^i[not its origination]’” (Vism-mhṭ 828).
^fn10 “Here in this world there is no self that is something other than and apart from the aggregates” (Vism-mhṭ 830). Cf. also: “When any ascetics or brahmans whatever see self in its various forms, they all of them see the five aggregates, or one of them” (S IV 46).
^fn11 “As a skilled man drilling a gem with a tool watches and keeps in mind only the hole he is drilling, not the gem’s colour, etc., so too the meditator wisely keeps in mind only the ceaseless dissolution of formations, not the formations” (Vism-mhṭ 830).
^fn12 The Harvard text reads “^i[khayato vayato suññato ti]—as destruction, as fall, as void.” But Vism-mhṭ says: “‘^i[The three appearances’]: in the threefold appearance as impermanent and so on. For appearance as destruction and fall is appearance as impermanent, appearance as terror is appearance as pain, and appearance as void is appearance as not-self (Vism-mhṭ 830).
^fn13 Vism-mhṭ defines the three kinds of worldliness (^i[āmisa]) as follows: ^i[Worldliness of the round (vaṭṭāmisa]) is that of the threefold round of past, future and present becoming; worldliness of the world (^i[lokāmisa]) is the five cords of sense desire (i.e. objects of sense desire including food, etc.) because they are accessible to defilements; ^i[worldliness of defilement (kilesāmisa]) is the defilements themselves (see Vism-mhṭ 836).
^fn14 The reference is to the happy destinies of the sense-desire world (human beings and deities), the fine-material Brahmā-world, and the immaterial Brahmā-world.
^fn15 For “ten kinds of elephants” of which the Chaddanta (Six-toothed) is the “best” see M-a II 25. Cf. also the description of the elephant called “Uposatha,” one of the seven treasures of the Wheel-turning Monarch (M II 173). On the expression “with sevenfold stance” (^i[sattappatiṭṭha]) Vism-mhṭ says“^i[Hatthapāda-vālavatthikosehi bhūmiphusanehi sattahi patiṭṭhito ti sattapatiṭṭho]” (Vism-mhṭ 838).
^fn16 Rāhu is the name for the eclipse of the sun or moon, personalized as a demon who takes them in his mouth (see S I 50–51 and M I 87).
^fn17 The sense seems to require a reading, “^i[Kāmañ ca na paṭhamaí]”…
^fn18 ^i[Dvikoṭika] (“double logical relation”) and ^i[catukoṭika] (“quadruple logical relation”): Skr. ^i[catuḥkoṭi] (cf. Th. Stcherbatsky, ^i[Buddhist Logi]c, pp. 60–61, note 5).
^fn19 There are a number of variant readings to this sutta passage (which is met with elsewhere as follows: A I 206; II 177; cf. III 170). There are also variant readings of the commentary, reproduced at M-a IV 63–65 and in the commentary to A II 177. The readings adopted are those which a study of the various contexts has indicated. The passage is a difficult one.
The sutta passage seems from its various settings to have been a phrase current among non-Buddhists, as a sort of slogan for naked ascetics (A I 206); and it is used to describe the base consisting of nothingness (M II 263), in which latter sense it is incorporated in the Buddha’s teaching as a description that can be made the basis for right view or wrong view according as it is treated.
The commentarial interpretation given here is summed up by Vism-mhṭ as follows: “‘^i[Nāhaí kvacini]’: he sees the non-existence of a self of his own. ‘^i[Na kassaci kiñcanat’asmií]’: he sees of his own self too that it is not the property of another’s self. ‘^i[Na ca mama]’: these words should be construed as indicated. ‘^i[Atthi]’ applies to each clause. He sees the nonexistence of another’s self thus, ‘There is no other’s self anywhere.’ He sees of another that that other is not the property of his own self thus, ‘My owning of that other’s self does not exist.’ So this mere conglomeration of formations is seen, by discerning it with the voidness of the quadruple logical relation, as voidness of self or property of a self in both internal and external aggregates’” (Vism-mhṭ 840–41 = ^i[ṭīkā] to MN 106).

^fn24 The cause and the fruit being secluded from each other (see Vism-mhṭ 842).
^fn25 “A meaning such as ‘what in common usage in the world is called a being is not materiality’ is not intended here because it is not implied by what is said; for the common usage of the world does not speak of mere materiality as a being. What is intended as a being is the self that is conjectured by outsiders” (Vism-mhṭ 842).
^fn26 “This is not in the text. If it were there would be forty-three ways” (Vism-mhṭ 842).

^fn32 When insight reaches its culmination, it settles down in one of the three contemplations [impermanence, pain, or not-self] and at this stage of the development the “seven contemplations” and the “eighteen contemplations” (or “principal insights”) are all included by the three (see Vism-mhṭ 844).
^fn33 “Contemplation of impermanence sees formations as limited by rise in the beginning and by fall in the end, and it sees that it is because they have a beginning and an end that they are impermanent. ‘^i[Into the signless element]’: into the unformed element, which is given the name ‘signless’ because it is the opposite of the sign of formations. ‘^i[To the entering of consciousness]’: to the higher consciousness’s completely going into by means of the state of conformity knowledge, after delimiting. ‘^i[Into the desireless]’: into the unformed element, which is given the name ‘desireless’ owing to the non-existence of desire due to greed and so on. ‘^i[Into the void]’: into the unformed element, which is given the name ‘void’ because of voidness of self” (Vism-mhṭ 845).
^fn34 “One who is pursuing insight by discerning formations according to their sign by means of the contemplation of impermanence and resolves according to the signless aspect thus, ‘Where this sign of formations is entirely nonexistent, that is, the signless Nibbāna’ joins insight leading to emergence with the path. Then the path realizes Nibbāna for him as signless. The signless aspect of Nibbāna is not created by the path or by insight; on the contrary, it is the establishment of the individual essence of Nibbāna, and the path is called signless because it has that as its object. One who resolves upon the desireless by keeping desire away by means of the contemplation of pain, and one who resolves upon the void by keeping the belief in self away by means of the contemplation of not-self, should both be construed in the same way” (Vism-mhṭ 846).
^fn35 “Why is signless insight unable to give its own name to the path when it has come to the point of arrival at the path? Of course, signless insight is mentioned in the suttas thus, ‘Develop the signless and get rid of the inherent tendency to conceit’ (Sn 342). Nevertheless, though it eliminates the signs of permanence, of lastingness, and of self, it still possesses a sign itself and is occupied with states that possess a sign. Again, the Abhidhamma is the teaching in the ultimate sense, and in the ultimate sense the cause of a signless path is wanting. For the signless liberation is stated in accordance with the contemplation of impermanence, and in that the faith faculty predominates. But the faith faculty is not represented by any one of the factors of the path. And so it cannot give its name to the path since it forms no part of it. In the case of the other two, the desireless liberation is due to the contemplation of pain, and the void liberation is due to the contemplation of not-self. Now the concentration faculty predominates in the desireless liberation and the understanding faculty in the void liberation. So since these are factors of the path as well, they can give their own names to the path; but there is no signless path because the factor is wanting. So some say. But there are others who say that there is a signless path, and that although it does not get its name from the way insight arrives at it, still it gets its name from a special quality of its own and from its object. In their opinion the desireless and void paths should also get their names from special qualities of their own and from their objects too. That is wrong. Why? Because the path gets its names for two reasons, that is, because of its own nature and because of what it opposes—the meaning is, because of its individual essence and because of what it is contrary to. For the desireless path is free from desire due to greed, etc., and the void path is free from greed too, so they both get their names from their individual essence. Similarly, the desireless path is the contrary of desire and the void path is the contrary of misinterpretation as self, so they get their names from what they oppose. On the other hand, the signless path gets its name only from its own nature owing to the non-existence in it of the signs of greed, etc., or of the signs of permanence, etc., but not owing to what it opposes. For it does not oppose the contemplation of impermanence, which has as its object the sign of formations [as formed], but remains in agreement with it. So a signless path is altogether inadmissible by the Abhidhamma method. This is why it is said, ‘This refers to the way in which insight arrives at the path and is expressed in the literal sense’ (§72).
“However, by the Suttanta method a signless path is admissible. For according to that, in whatever way insight leading to emergence (see §83) effects its comprehending it still leads on to emergence of the path, and when it is at the point of arrival it gives its own name to the path accordingly—when emerging owing to comprehension as impermanent the path is signless, when emerging owing to comprehension as painful it is desireless, and when emerging owing to comprehension as not-self it is void. Taking this as a sutta commentary, therefore, three liberations are differentiated here. But in the Paṭisambhidā the deliverance from misinterpreting, from the sign and from desire, are taken respectively as the arrival of the three kinds of comprehension at that deliverance, and what is described is a corresponding state of void liberation, etc., respectively in the paths that follow upon that deliverance. There is no question of treating that literally, which is why he said, ‘However, in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge’ and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 846–48).
^fn36 “‘^i[From the object interpreted as the sign]’: from the pentad of aggregates as the object of insight; for that pentad of aggregates is called the ‘object interpreted’ on account of the interpreting, in other words, on account of being made the domain of insight. And although it is included in one’s own continuity, it is nevertheless called ‘external’ because it is seen as alien to it; it is that too which in other contexts is spoken of as ‘externally from all signs’ (Paṭis I 71). ‘Internally from occurrence’: from the occurrence of wrong view, etc., in one’s own continuity, and from the defilements and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon them. For it is stated in this way because there is occurrence of defilement in one’s own continuity and because there is occurrence of clung-to aggregates produced by that [defilement] when there is no path development. And emergence consists both in making these the object and in producing their non-liability to future arising” (Vism-mhṭ 853).
^fn37 “‘^i[Emerges from the internal]’ is said figuratively owing to the fact that in this case the insight leading to emergence has an internal state as its object. In the literal sense, however, the path emerges from both” (Vism-mhṭ 853).
^fn38 “Said in the Discourse on Purification (^i[visuddhi-kathā])” (Vism-mhṭ 855). See XX.77.
^fn39 “The first ‘^i[some]’ refers to the Elder Tipiṭaka Cūḷa-Nāga. The second ‘^i[some]’ refers to the Elder Mahā Datta, dweller at Moravāpi. The third ‘some’ refers to the Elder Tipiṭaka Cūḷa Abhaya” (Vism-mhṭ 856).
^fn40 The four predominances are those of zeal (desire), energy, consciousness, and inquiry. Cf. four roads to power (Dhs §73–74; Vibh 216 and Comy.).
^fn41 “If this is so, then is the path that follows on the contemplation of impermanence not included in the Abhidhamma?—That is not so; for it is included in the method of ‘simple progress’ (^i[suddhika paṭipadā]—see Dhs §§339–340)” (Vism-mhṭ 861).
^fn42 “‘^i[Maintaining the continuity of consciousness]’ by absence of interruption, in other words, of occurrence of dissimilar consciousness. For when the life-continuum [which is mind-consciousness element] is displaced by the functional mind element [of five- door adverting (70)], the occurrence of the functional consciousness makes an interruption, an interval, between the occurrence of the resultant consciousness [i.e. the life-continuum and the consciousness that follows]. But this is not so with mind- door adverting (71) [which is mind-consciousness element]” (Vism-mhṭ 862). See Table V, Cognitive Series.
^fn43 “Aloofness”—^i[atammayatā]: not in PED. See also M III 43. The word is made up of ^i[a + taí + maya + tā] = “not-made-of-that-ness.” Its meaning is non-attachment to any form of being.
^fn44 The word ^i[vodāna] (“cleansing”) is used, in its loose sense of “purifying” in general, in I.143. For its technical Abhidhammasense here see Ch. XXII note 7.
^c22
^fn1 “‘^i[Of emerging and turning away from the external]’: it is the understanding of turning away that is being effected, which turning away is emergence from the field of formations; it is termed external because the unformed element’s existence is external” (Vism-mhṭ 866). The unformed element (=Nibbāna) is classed as “external” under the internal (^i[ajjhattika]) triad of the ^i[Abhidhamma Mātikā] (see Dhs 2 and p. 241).
^fn2 ^i[Pakkhandati]—“enters into is glossed there by ^i[anupavisati] (enters in Vism-mhṭ (p. 566), which is the sense required and may be taken as based on the idiom in the Suttas, “^i[Cittaí pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati adhimuccati]—the mind enters into [that], becomes settled, steady and resolute” (M I 186), which is obviously inappropriate here.
^fn3 ^i[Phalakasataí]—“target”: not in PED. Vism-mhṭ says “^i[Phalakasatan ti asana-sāra- mayaí phalakasataí]—a “^i[phalakasata]” is one made of the heart (pith) of the ^i[asana] tree.” The “wheel contrivance” resembles a potter’s wheel according to Vism-mhṭ (p.867).
^fn4 The seven (noble) treasures are: faith, virtue, conscience, shame, learning, generosity, and understanding (D III 251).
^fn5 See the five kinds of enmity and fear at S II 68f. Vism-mhṭ, however, says: “The five kinds of enmity beginning with killing living things and the twenty-five great terrors (^i[mahā-bhayāni]) are what constitute ‘^i[all enmity and fear]’” (Vism-mhṭ 867).
^fn6 For the use of the expression “brings to bear”—^i[samodhāneti] in this sense see Paṭis I 181.
^fn7 “Here ‘^i[change-of-lineage]’ means ‘like change-of-lineage’; for the knowledge that ushers in the [first] path is called that in the literal sense because it overcomes the ordinary man’s lineage and develops the Noble One’s lineage. But this is called ‘change-of-lineage’ figuratively because of its similarity to the other. It is also called ‘cleansing’ (^i[vodāna]) because it purifies from certain defilements and because it makes absolute purification its object. Hence it is said in the Paṭṭhāna, ‘Conformity is a condition, as proximity condition, for cleansing’ (Paṭṭh I 59). But ‘^i[next to change-of-lineage]’ is said here because it is said in the Paṭisambhidāmagga that for the purpose of ‘overcoming arising,’ etc., ‘eight states of change-of-lineage arise through concentration’ and ‘ten states of change-of-lineage arise through concentration’ and ‘ten states of change-of-lineage arise through insight’ (Paṭis I 68–69), and it is given in the same way in this page” (Vism-mhṭ 869).
^fn8 The four foundations of mindfulness are fully commented on in the commentary to MN 10 (= commentary to DN 22). The right endeavours are fully commented on in the commentary to the Sammappadhāna Vibhaṅga (cf. M-a II 243ff.; also A-a commenting on AN 1:II 1). The four roads to power are briefly commented on at M-a II 69 and fully in the commentary to the M-a I 82f. and more fully in the commentary to the Bojjhaṅga Vibhaṅga. The Noble Eightfold Path is commented on at M-a I 105 and from a different angle in the commentary to the Magga Vibhaṅga. The five faculties and the five powers are not apparently dealt with in the Nikāya and the Abhidhamma Commentaries by adding anything further to what is said here (§37).
^fn9 The Paṭisambhidā (Paṭis I 177) derives ^i[satipaṭṭhāna] from ^i[sati] (mindfulness) and ^i[paṭṭhāna] (foundation, establishment). The commentaries prefer to derive it from ^i[sati] and ^i[upaṭṭhāna] (establishment, appearance, and also waiting upon: see M-a I 238). The readings of the Ee and Ae eds. disagree here and that of the former has been followed though the result is much the same.
^fn10 These figures refer to the numbers of different contemplations described in the tenth sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya (= DN 22).
^fn11 These three abstinences are the “prior state” of the Eightfold Path (see M III 289). “Only the road to power consisting in zeal, and right speech, are actually included here; but when these are mentioned, the remaining roads to power and remaining two abstinences are implied in the meaning too. The meaning of this sentence should be understood according to the ‘category of characteristics’ (^i[lakkhaṇa-hāra]—see Nettipakaraṇa)” (Vism-mhṭ 872). This Netti rule says: 
^stz “When one thing has been stated, then those things That are in characteristic one with it Are stated too–this is the formulation Of the category of characteristics” (Netti 3).
^fn12 “Emergence from the sign consists in relinquishing the sign of formations and making Nibbāna the object. Emergence from occurrence consists in entering upon the state of non-liability to the occurrence of kamma-result in the future by causing the cessation of cause” (Vism-mhṭ 874).
^fn13 “It emerges from the defilements of uncertainty, etc., that occur consequent upon that view, which is wrong since it leads to states of loss” (Vism-mhṭ 874).
^fn14 “‘^i[Wrong knowledge],’ which is wrong because it does not occur rightly [i.e. in conformity with the truth], and is wrong and mistaken owing to misinterpretations, etc., is just delusion. ‘^i[Wrong deliverance]’ is the wrong notion of liberation that assumes liberation to take place in a ‘World Apex’ (^i[lokathūpika–]see XVI.85), and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 886).
^fn15 The meaning of this paragraph is made clearer by reference to the ^i[Atthasālinī] (Dhs-a 48) and ^i[Mūla ṭīkā] (Dhs-ṭ 51), where the use of ^i[ā] as an adverb in the sense of “as far as” indirectly with the ablative (^i[gotrabhuto], etc.) is explained; the abl. properly belongs to ^i[savana] (i.e. exudations from). Vism-mhṭ only says: “‘^i[Exudations]’ (^i[savana]) because of occurring [due to], ^i[savanato] (“^i[because of exuding]”) is because of flowing out as filth of defilement. ^i[Savanato] (“^i[because of producing]”) the second time is because of giving out (^i[pasavana])” (Vism-mhṭ 876. Cf. also M-a I 61).
^fn16 “The intention is: or it follows that there is dissociation of defilements from consciousness, like that of formations according to those who assert that formations exist dissociated form consciousness. He said, ‘there is no such thing as a present defilement dissociated from consciousness’ in order to show that that is merely the opinion of those who make the assertion. For it is when immaterial states are actually occurring by their having a single basis and being included in the three instants that they are present; so how could that be dissociated from consciousness? Consequently there is no dissociation from consciousness here” (Vism-mhṭ 878).
^fn17 “‘^i[Shackled]’: one whose consciousness is shackled by conceit (pride)” (Vism-mhṭ 878).
^fn18 “‘^i[In any given plane]’ means aggregates as objects of clinging, reckoned as a human or divine person” (Vism-mhṭ 879).
^fn19 “By the words ‘which are the object of insight’ he points out the non-fully- understood state of the aggregates, not merely the fact that they are the object of insight, which is proved by his taking only the three planes. For it is not-fully- understood aggregates among the aggregates constituting the [subjective] basis that are intended as the ‘soil of defilements’” (Vism-mhṭ 880).
^fn20 “No one would be able to abandon the root of becoming if it were in another’s continuity. ‘^i[With respect to the basis [for them in oneself]]’ means as the place of their arising; in that particular becoming or continuity” (Vism-mhṭ 880).
^fn21 “‘^i[With the contact of knowledge by personal experience]’ means by personal experience of it as object, which is what the ‘contact of knowledge’ is called. The words, ‘By personal experience’ exclude taking it as an object by inference. For what is intended here as the ‘contact of knowledge’ is knowing by personal experience through reviewing thus, ‘This is like this’” (Vism-mhṭ 888).
^fn22 The first elision here—“The eye … ageing-and-death”—is explained in XX.9. The second elision—“One who sees suffering … One who sees Nibbāna, which merges in the deathless in the sense of end …”—covers all things listed from Paṭis I 8, line 18 (N.B. the new para in the Paṭis text should begin with the words “^i[dukkhaí abhiññeyyaí]” up to p. 22, line 11, ^i[amatogadhaí nibbānaí pariyosānatthaí abhiññeyyaí]). In this case, however (Paṭis I 35), ^i[sacchikātabba] (“to be realized”), etc., is substituted for ^i[abhiññeyya] (“to be directly known”).
^c23
^fn1 “It is the Andhakas, etc., who maintain this; for they take the sutta wrongly which says, ‘“Arahantship” is said, friend Sāriputta; what is Arahantship?—The destruction of greed, the destruction of hate, the destruction of delusion: that is what is called Arahantship” (S IV 252), taking it literally and asserting that nothing exists called Arahantship and that it is only the abandoning of defilements that is so called by common usage. And they deny that there are any other fruitions” (Vism-mhṭ 891).
^fn2 The quotation in the Vism texts does not quite agree with the Paṭis text (Ee) where (as the sense demands) the words “^i[bahiddhā saṅkhāranimittaí]” do not follow the four fruitions and the two abidings but only the four paths.
^fn3 “Although they are resultant states, nevertheless the states of fruition attainment occur in the noble person only when he chooses since they do not arise without the
^fn4 “Why does change-of-lineage not have Nibbāna as its object here as it does when it precedes the path? Because states belonging to fruition are not associated with an outlet [as in the case of the path]. For this is said: ‘What states are an outlet? The four unincluded paths’ (Dhs §1592)” (Vism-mhṭ 895).
^fn5 “Those of the Abhayagiri Monastery in Anurādhapura” (Vism-mhṭ 895).
^fn6 “The ‘^i[volition]’ is attaining after deciding the time limit in this way, ‘When the moon, or the sun, has gone so far, I shall emerge,’ which is an act of volition” (Vism-mhṭ 897).
^fn7 “It is because he is called ‘emerged from attainment’ as soon as the life-continuum consciousness has arisen that ‘^i[he brings to mind that which is the object of the life-continuum]’ is said. Kamma, etc., are called the object of the life-continuum (see Ch. XVII, §133ff.)” (Vism-mhṭ 897).
^fn8 The list in brackets represents in summarized form the things listed at Paṭis I 94– 95, repeated in this context in the Paṭisambhidā but left out in the Vism quotation.
^fn9 The serenity shown here is access concentration (see Vism-mhṭ 899).
^fn10 The nine are the four fine-material jhānas, the four immaterial jhānas, and the access concentration preceding each of the eight attainments, described in the last sentence and counted as one.
^fn11 “The word ‘^i[profitable]’ used in this Paṭṭhāna passage shows that it app1ies only to non-returners, otherwise ‘functional’ would have been said” (Vism-mhṭ 902).
^fn12 “They say so because of absence of heart-basis; but the meaning is because of absence of basis called physical body. For if anyone were to attain cessation in the immaterial worlds he would become indefinable (^i[appaññattika]) owing to the non- existence of any consciousness or consciousness concomitant at all, and he would be as though attained to final Nibbāna without remainder of results of past clinging; for what remainder of results of past clinging could be predicated of him when he had entered into cessation? So it is because of the lack of the necessary factors that there is no attaining of the attainment of cessation in the immaterial worlds” (Vism-mhṭ 902).
^fn13 “‘^i[Reaching the cessation that is Nibbāna]’: as though reaching Nibbāna without remainder of result of past clinging. ‘In bliss’ means without suffering” (Vism-mhṭ 902).
^fn14 “‘^i[It should be resolved]’: the thought should be aroused. For here the resolve consists in arousing the thought. In the non-arising of consciousness-originated materiality, etc., and in the absence of support by a postnascence condition, etc., the physical body continues the same only for seven days; after that it suffers wastage. So he limits the duration to seven days when he attains cessation, they say” (Vism-mhṭ 903).
^fn15 ^i[Paribhaṇḍa]—“repair work”: this meaning is not given in PED; cf. M-a IV 157 (patching of old robes), and M-a I 291.
^fn16 The word ^i[atthuppatti] (“the origin being a need arisen”) is a technical commentarial term. “There are four kinds of origins (^i[uppatti]) or setting forth of suttas (^i[sutta-nikkhepa]): on account of the speaker’s own inclination (^i[attajjhāsaya]), on account of another’s inclination (^i[parajjhāsaya]), as the result of a question asked (^i[pucchāvasika]), and on account of a need arisen (^i[atthuppattika])’ (M-a I 15, see also Ch. III.88).
^fn17 “‘^i[Vital formations]’ are the same as 1ife span; though some say that they are the life span, heat and consciousness. These are the object only of his normal consciousness. There is no death during cessation because dying takes place by means of the final life-continuum [consciousness]. He should attain only after adverting thus, ‘Let sudden death not occur.’ For in the case of sudden death he would not be able to declare final knowledge, advise the bhikkhus, and testify to the Dispensation’s power. And there would be no reaching the highest path in the case of a non-returner” (Vism-mhṭ 904).
^fn18 The subtleties of the word ^i[nipphanna] are best cleared up by quoting a paragraph from the ^i[Sammohavinodanī] (Vibh-a 29): “The five aggregates are positively-produced (^i[parinipphanna]) always, not un-positively-produced (^i[aparinipphanna]); they are always formed, not unformed. Besides, they are produced (^i[nipphanna]) as well. For among the dhammas that are individual essences (^i[sabhāva-dhamma]) it is only Nibbāna that is un-positively-produced and un-produced (^i[anipphanna]).” The ^i[Mūla ṭīkā] comments on this: “What is the difference between the positively-produced and the produced? A dhamma that is an individual essence with a beginning and an end in time, produced by conditions, and marked by the three characteristics, is ^i[positively produced]. But besides this, what is ^i[produced] [but not positively produced] is a dhamma with no individual essence (^i[asabhāva-dhamma]) when it is produced by the taking of a name or by attaining [the attainment of cessation]” (Vibh-a 23). Cf. also XIV.72 and 77.
